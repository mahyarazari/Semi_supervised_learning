"It&#146;s the best looking, most enticingly put together football game this year, but playing it is about as enjoyable as watching The Jets get mauled the first few weeks of this season.",8
"The Nintendo LABO Variety Kit has some fun and satisfying aspects to it, but it lacks any real longevity. And now I’m faced with the ultimate dilemma – where the heck will I store all these cardboard projects now?",8
"But as far as sound investments go, buying up Final Fantasy XII, Suikoden V, Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne and Dragon Quest VIII will get you a lot more bang for considerably less money -- you might even have enough left over to go grab one of the oft-overlooked Shadow Hearts games.",8
"Starts out with a bang, but then quickly falls to a whimper -- that whimper being the controls. Never in all my life would I have thought it possible to make a game that is so impossible to control with any degree of efficiency.",7
"Valkyria Revolution tells a decent tale of war, but the strength of that story is dulled by overlong, boring, and poorly animated cutscenes. It sacrifices the unique historical setting and art style of the Valkyria Chronicles series proper in favor of generic JRPG elements that fail to leave a strong impression, and its hack-and-slash combat offers little in the way of strategy and ruins its own flow with an poorly matched magic system.",6
"Simple, childish fun that never tries to be more than it can be, and younger kids will have a great time helping their favourite superheroes save the world. Anyone who has hit puberty, on the too light on real gameplay for your tastes.other hand, should steer clear as Super Hero Squad will be far.",7
"It’s easy to list all of the ways in which RPG Maker Fes is limited in terms of scope, tools, available assets, and possibilities—but it’s also hard to deny how fun it can be when you’re crafting something within the parameters of those limitations. Those looking for a deep RPG creation program will be sorely disappointing, but for players looking for a first step in that idea, or those preferring to craft something a little less grandiose, this is still an exceptionally cool—and unexpected—release on our shores.",6
"It’s nice that no feeble attempt was made to force the stylus into the pinball format, but it would have been better to see some more multiplayer options and maybe just a couple more tables. Really, that’s the only thing wrong with this otherwise fantastic title.",7
"The good thing is, the game is priced as a value title, and for puzzle fanatics, or for fans of the PSP titles, this is a great package. But honestly, playing Lumines made me long for the intricate simplicity of Tetris, and it's just a reminder that perfection, once achieved, can be hard to top.",6
"The best Evil Dead game to be released to date. For the low price they are asking any Evil Dead fan or action gamer needs to check this out. Ash is back with some Bubba Ho-Tep style. Hail to the king, baby!",7
"Commandos 2: HD Remaster graphically upgrades a beloved tactical classic and gives a fresh coat of paint to a fairly obtuse set of controls. While it is shipping with a few bugs, all of the pieces that made this game a classic are present and accounted for. With just a little more polish we’ll be able to “Consider it done, boss”.",8
"Track Lab is a well-crafted experience. It looks good, sounds even better and is wonderfully intuitive, even for people with no prior knowledge of music creation. Its definitely worth your time if you are interested in music or puzzle games. Its a good VR title, but the ability to share your music would push it over from good to great.",8
"Neither a full horror experience nor a complex puzzle game, Close to the Sun is a narrative adventure with an amazing atmosphere plagued by issues in both gameplay and storytelling. Despite the lack of originality this is definitely a step forward for the Italian team of Storm in a Teacup and an appealing world to explore.",6
"This is probably the darkest, weirdest and most unique Zelda ever released, and it's still as good as it was on N64. The visual improvements and the gameplay tweaks are reason enough to go back to it, if you haven't played it before.",10
"Overall Hellbound meets expectations as a retro style 90’s Shooter. Whilst it does not innovate as much as some people would like, this game has enough about it to be worth the pickup.",8
"If you like RTS management then this game does very little wrong but if story is something you want, I can not recommend RailGrade. Well, unless corporate hoo-ha is something that entertains you then this has a lot of that.",8
"The biggest weakness of Monaco is the simplicity of its gameplay – it’s a trivial, almost mobile game. I recommend playing it in a 4 players co-op mode, where the low difficulty level and simple rules are not so bothersome. [CD-Action 07/2013, p.78]",7
"It has a unique look and premise, and while some of its gameplay mechanics are a little shallow, everything works well enough together to make it a worthwhile purchase, especially at its $20 price tag. So put on a mask and prepare to go gambling, but beware of talking fish. They have evil hearts.",8
"The perfect arcade classic package for hardcore retro gamers, parents looking for something simpler and less disturbing for kids and, of course, thirty-somethings looking to recapture a little of their past glory.",8
"Stays true to the spirit of the old Heroes of Might & Magic games. There are some gameplay innovations, most of which are good, but basically it feels very familiar. Whether this is good or bad depends on the player, but overall Heroes VI is a fine specimen of an almost extinct genre. [Nov 2011]",9
"Hard West 2 is a solid experience despite some shortcomings and missed opportunities. Ice Code Games crafted a unique and action-packed combat system while retaining much of what makes this type of strategy game so engaging. It may not have the production values or depth of either XCOM or Gears Tactics, but Hard West 2 still manages to be an addicting and satisfactory turn-based strategy experience.",7
"I haven’t played the first This Is The Police, but I can’t help but feel like the sequel simply adds too much. The game feels like it needs to refocus on the day to day policing and the small storylets that accompany it, which are great. Unless the message is that running a police department is an impossible task, in which case: mission accomplished.",5
"Hopefully next time APF will be a fully functional game, so we can focus our complaints on the important issues, like how in the world Bubby Brister made anyone's list of 'legends.'",8
"Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania marks a return to form for the series, even if I am left hoping that we receive some substantial content updates in the near future to fill in gaps left from the originals. Fans who need an exact recreation of the originals or require challenge mode multiplayer might want to skip this one or wait for a deep discount, but those who just want to play Super Monkey Ball 1 and 2 again or the first time should absolutely pick this one up on Switch, especially if you enjoy playing on the go. While there is still a bit of work to do, Super Monkey Ball is back, and it’s a great feeling. I strongly recommend you don’t miss out on this one.",8
"A great party game, that'll keep a party going with its variety of nutty mini-games. As with any Kinect game, it has its foibles, but get some friends around and you'll have a blast. The only downside is an issue of longevity, as once you've exhausted the mini-games, you're unlikely to go back.",7
"SBCGfAP is packed with little extras and mini-games, although none provide more than a few minutes of diversion. The real fun is discovering all of the inside jokes from the series plastered throughout.",7
"Claymore Game Studios realized what made the original Commandos games so great, retained the heart and soul, and sanded off all the prickly edges. Commandos: Origins is a love letter to the originals in everything it does. The mechanic-heavy sandbox gameplay, the unique cast of commandos, the gorgeous environments, and the level design, all of it coalesces into an experience that is contemplative and intense. It’s a brilliant and challenging strategy game. And doesn’t it feel damn good to punch Nazis?",9
"Sure, the improvements to the heat level are fantastic, and it’s great to have a game that has really solid handling and physics, but it would have been nice to see the series break a little more new ground.",7
"Ghost Trick is a little bit linear and drive the player into the epilogue without difficulty, but it is one of the most articulate, engaging and funny adventure published in recent years for Nintendo DS.",8
"Track Lab is an original and unique game. It is not the best puzzle game you will play, the editor is limited and rudimentary. Nevertheless, music lovers will find it fun and interesting.",7
"Lego City Undercover nails the best aspects of open world games in its own way, and with the inclusion of Lego building mechanics, it feels enough like its own thing rather than a sanitized version of an existing thing.",9
"Even if you’ve exhausted all other options and are desperate for another turn-based strategy game on PS4, don’t give the sluggish, buggy and downright ugly Jagged Alliance: Rage a second thought. XCOM 2 this most certainly isn’t.",4
"Even though Wings over Europe has a lot of stiff competition from other games, I can’t seem to get the odd ‘leaning at 90 degrees’ sensation out of my head. There’s always a new trick or manoeuvre to attempt in a different mission in a different plane. Maybe someday I’ll figure out how to drop bombs.",7
"Many puzzle games these days try to hold your hand too much, but The Sojourn certainly does not. At the same time this beautiful and serene atmosphere ensures that you don't get too frustrated.",8
"Aside of being visually remarkable, Oil Rush is a clever and elegant strategy game that combines RTS and Tower Defense mechanics to create an interesting hybrid, not as demanding as a RTS, but more active and dynamic than TD, reaching an attractive and very well executed middle point.",8
A great way to enjoy the original game but now with all content included and the portable option. A great success in technical terms that sadly didn't take advantage of the Switch's touch screen.,8
"I just wished that Fatshark had tried to be as original in the gameplay as they have in the visual direction. At times, it just felt like I was playing a mod, and depending on how you look at it that’s either the biggest compliment or the absolute worst thing I could say about Vermintide.",8
"While this isn't my personal choice for a MOBA, I think it is a great take on the arena-styled MMO. You may find like me that the matches should be longer, but it will give you hours of enjoyment and if this is your game you could find a niche in a clan too. If you enjoy leveling up and progressing your character this is the wrong game for you. However, if you like to immediately jump into the thick of the action and climb a mountain of corpses to reach your victory, then Bloodline Champions has plenty to love.",8
"Filled with a relaxing soundtrack and delightful minimalist visuals, Ovivo is a mellow game that has a feeling of whimsy across its world. While the presentation may be a bit lacking, this game is a unique treat in the platformer genre.",8
"For those of you looking for a PC title to hone your poker playing skills then this may not be a bad title for you. If you are looking to play with other people, then I suggest getting a few of your friends together and playing around the table with some real cards, nothing beats the real thing.",8
"A great addition to any GBA collection...While there may be instances where the lack of a vertically scrolling screen can unfairly get you killed, the quality of the game's other elements is ample compensation for this annoyance. [Nov 2004, p.117]",7
"This remake changes that title – for the better, from a technical view – but that’s likely to mess with fans’ nostalgic tendencies and will confuse returning players at points. But, for anyone playing Majora’s Mask for the first time, this is an extremely refined reworking of a game which would likely feel archaic and broken if released again in its original state.",9
"Pac-Man might not be your typical platforming protagonist, but he’s earned his chance to shine – and Pac-Man World Re-Pac certainly gives him that opportunity. This remake of a forgotten gem has “wholesome fun” written all over it thanks to its bright and bold art style, its well-designed levels and its wealth of collectibles waiting to be hoovered up. If you’re a 3D platforming fan, make sure this is on your radar.",7
"FC 25 is an enjoyable, yet unexciting entry with welcome additions such Rush and big updates to Manager Career. Those expecting notable changes anywhere else will be left disappointed, though there’s more than enough here to keep the annual title kicking along.",8
"If you were a fan of the first Darksiders, then this is definitely a worthy sequel that you should enjoy. However, if you are new to the series I would advise reading up on the first one a little so the story isn't too confusing before you pick it up. Either way, if you enjoy a dungeon crawling adventure game with RPG elements, then I can easily recommend you grab a copy of Darksiders 2 and embrace Death, with just a few reservations.",8
"Majora’s Mask is an odd one, but it’s a legendary game from Nintendo’s library, and one that deserves a rerelease. With its graphical improvements and system enhancements, one of the best Zelda games is even better this time around — and that’s really saying something.",10
"Foretales is a distinctive and entertaining card-based narrative adventure. The game mechanics that blend exploration, resource management, and combat are always intriguing and varied, if occasionally a bit more complex than they should be. Plot, characters, and setting are interesting to discover, and the game structure is designed to make replaying over and over enjoyable.",8
"After Us is an atmospheric platforming adventure that leaves you thinking about the beauty in extinction rather than the horrors. With slick controls, appealing environments to explore and a tranquil nonintrusive soundtrack, fans of titles like Journey will likely enjoy the exploration of a surreal and desolate world of post-human life.",8
"Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team is a nice twin analog shooter, packed with good graphics, four different units to choose and a lot of weapons and upgrades. What a pity the game has no online multiplayer and only five levels.",7
"As a movie port using the oldest recipe in the book, Constantine is about as average a game as you can get, which is actually better than most licensed translations. Neither Heaven nor Hell, Constantine is merely a short stay in Purgatory.",4
"Some games run into problems trying to be everything to everyone, but SimCity Creator suffers from the opposite affliction. It doesn’t try to be anything to anyone. Well, that’s one thing it does right.",5
"It’s a broken game, unfinished, derivative and sloppily produced, filled with uninteresting environments and levels. A pirate’s life is supposedly full of action and adventure, but you’ll find none of it here.",3
"The great level design, intense combat setpieces, and the incredibly depressing design aesthetic are all top-notch. It's a prime example of great execution elevating a tired premise.",8
"Hard West 2 lives in the same weird supernatural world and displays the same shoddy workmanship as the original game, but lost a lot of variety. One boring playthrough is the limit.",6
"Does the “Zeldalike” genre exist? If it does, Rogue Heroes would be the perfect example: easy to pick up, but deep and complex enough if you try to go for 100% completion, with a top-down perspective view, pixel-art graphics and a story that leads us to travel in a big, hostile open world. While it does not achieve the excellence of its mentor, it stands out for it interesting gameplay choices such as the village management and an open world-oriented approach. To be played on your own digging up one secret after another, or in chaotic runs with up to three friends. Some repetitive sections and a few glitches only partially cloud what is overall a satysfying experience.",8
"Drakensang is a good roleplaying game: classic style, deep and with a nice plot. It has several problems with the management of the party but it's a surprise for those searching for an interesting game with a low price.",8
"It's easy to control and is so lifelike in it's recreation of the card game, that I wouldn't be surprised if the hardcore Yu-Gi-Oh! fans chuck their card books and play with their DS' instead.",8
"This is a game that puts the racing experience front and center. The physics model of the pros at Milestone is a piece of art that has only matured over the years. The sensation of speed might not be there yet and the console versions' 30 FPS are an issue, but the handling of the bikes is almost perfect.",8
"Part Time UFO is the best game I've ever played where you control an alien ship while completing mundane tasks. Okay, that didn't sound like a glowing endorsement but it is a cool little game and it's even more fun when you play it with a chum.",7
"Tech Support: Error Unknown features a mix of Papers Please! gameplay mechanics and Orwell gameplay and mechanics. It does not innovate but it manages to convey the angst of working as IT support, especially for an evil mega-corp.",7
"There is so much more I want to say, but I do not want to ruin any part of this experience. Being such a huge fan of the original game, I could not be happier with how this sequel turned out. After being lukewarm on the first entry, this one squashes all my concerns and doubts about this remake.",10
"There's not much in the way of weapon or enemy variety, and the game is pretty short, but just about every minute of it is action packed. The dynamic difficulty system works very well.",8
"The game welcomes you to historical Warsaw surrounded by esoteric beings. If you are not afraid of them, you can tame them. Expect a rich story and dialogue, but the combat won't be for everyone.",7
"There was so much potential in Criminal Girls: Invite Only to be a transgressive, unique experience, but sadly, narrative missteps limit it from ever realising that potential. Instead what we have is a genuinely entertaining and original combat, and a minigame that, were Criminal Girls to be a higher profile release, would have been controversial indeed.",7
Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood is one of those games that has “cult hit” written all over it – maybe it won’t hit critical mass with a general audience but those that appreciate a good shooter and a well-told story should be happy.,8
"On one hand it blends two really good ideas with slightly sloppy gameplay to create a game that is more frantic than fun. On the other hand, the complex combo system allows you to get an experience unlike anything else on the DS. That is to say, when it works, it really works well.",7
"The original and bold, Call of Juarez draws you into it’s brutally clichéd Wild West adventure complete with a fun online mode, interesting story, gritty violence, and authentic gun play.",8
"The first non-Japanese-developed Ridge Racer borrows heavily from games like Burnout and Need for Speed to deliver an enjoyable and full-of-adrenaline racing experience. It's not the best racer out there, but it can be fun!",7
"A beautiful story and compact gameplay of this game are spoiled by some technical issues and by a lower difficulty level. Thanks to its dynamic fighting system, its absence of grind mechanics and because the mix of those two is easily understandable, this Japanese RPG game is perfect not only for the newcomers to the genre, but also to those players, who wish to mainly enjoy the story, and who wish to take a break from long and hardcore games.",8
"A decent brawler, even if way too similar to Cyberconnect's Naruto series. Some interesting changes to the mechanics make this a fun fighting game, but it's definitely not a technical one nor amongst the most original.",7
"With no game like Tropico 5: Penultimate Edition available for Xbox One, fans of the genre should definitely give the game a look. It makes for a good summer game as you build and develop an island colony during your downtime and prepare for your presidential run in 2020.",8
"Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit is definitely worth the 15 euros. The story line, side-missions and Achievements/Trophies will keep you busy for a good 15 hours or so. Rabbit Ash might not be very innocent, despite that, he's the crazy awesome superstar of Hell Yeah!",8
"This type of design is an infuriating and transparent attempt to pad out the length of the game by making simple quests take longer to complete. Worse still, the occasional need to fire off a spell or two is entirely governed by Akko’s magical potion supply, which can only be replenished by spending money earned by repetitively grinding dungeon battles. It breaks my heart that Little Witch Academia: The Chamber of Time turned out the way it did, because the aesthetic success is undeniable, as is APlus’ attempt to design something that functions on a deeper level than just delivering fanservice.",5
"The First Berserker: Khazan is a solid Soulslike that just doesn’t do anything special. Even though the developers do a good job creating skill trees to match each weapon, there’s a serious lack of variety when it comes to the arsenal and attributes. On top of that, while the bosses are a treat to fight, being a significant challenge that evolves with the story, the same can’t be said about the mission structure. These are lacking functionally and artistically in their design, creating less-than-compelling locales to fight through. Despite all of our issues with The First Berserker: Khazan, it still scratched an itch that many Soulslikes haven’t been able to.",7
"Quarrel is a masterful combination of classic tabletop war gaming and wordsmithing. For those that enjoy the domination gameplay of Risk but recoil at the overly random nature of dice rolls, Quarrel is worth a look. If you're a word nerd that is looking for a competitive experience that is fresher than Words with Friends, this is the game you've been waiting for.",9
"There's very little to like in this package. With a backbone as strong as How to Train Your Dragon, there shouldn't have been much of a problem creating a fun game for children with the license.",8
"The original Superhot was a truly unique experience, masterful in its execution of a simple concept. Mind Control Delete loses some of the novelty of the original but succeeds in exploring new ways to make the game fun. It's a great example of “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” and while some will lament the loss of hand-crafted levels, most should be happy with the endlessly-replayable collection of content now in their hands.",9
"It would be easy to give Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 an easy time simply because it's on the Wii and is a mini-game collection, but when the original game is a far more impressive game, Rabbids 2 has nowhere to hide.",5
"The tongue-in-cheek Cold War-era humour is preferable to Cities XL's hard-faced exterior, but Haemimont's skill in masking the behind-the-scenes mechanisms pales in comparison to Mote Cristo's effort. [Dec 2009, p.118]",6
"If you are a fan of the series and can handle some of the hang-ups found in this latest chapter then by all means snatch it up, I know I could use more people online to play with. However, most FPS gamers looking for the next best thing will find Payback a bit too much on the derivative side to warrant its full price tag.",6
"Bottomline, all things considered, if you’re looking for a fun, fast, short-lived, throwback FPS game, Hellbound is definitely worth considering. Just don’t expect too much out of it and you’ll find your time and money well spent.",6
"Though hard to grasp for the uninitiated, Telltale's Game of Thrones is a truly meaty addition to the established tale, creating a gut-twisting fantasy drama that will leave you feeling absolutely awful, just like Game of Thrones should.",9
"Melbits World offers an experience that can be attractive to a family, specially to children. Despite some flaws and although it has no replay value, it represents an interesting option for gatherings and leisure time.",8
"Pikuniku's minimalistic visuals, wacky humour, overall happy vibe, light collect-athon mindset, and simple gameplay mechanics, make it a good pick for those who just want to kill an evening or two with something that's fun, but not that demanding. Sadly, there's a severe lack of content at hand, which is surprising given the length of it all.",6
"Outside of the glaive, the game boasts little that feels original, although Hayden’s sprinting ability is intentionally difficult to control, which adds makes the simple act of running more challenging.",7
"The combat, gameplay structure and presentation appears very recognizable as it is in line with other games in the genre. The lack of variety in environments is a shame in this regard, but in return you get a strong visual style, engaging different fighting styles, exciting boss fights, strong audio and much more. Recommended.",8
"If four players do a round of You're in the Movies, a round will take approx. 30 minutes of time. It is an entertaining game, but there are some technical problems concerning shadows, light and distance. Another problem is that the mini games get boring after a short time.",7
"In the end, The Sexy Brutale is a fascinating murder mystery game. The indirect methods that are used to obtain clues and solve each murder are different from other games in the genre. Though you may be able to stumble upon the solution for a murder or two via dumb luck, the game rewards you for careful observation to the audio and visuals. If you can overcome the keyboard/mouse controls in lieu of a control pad, you'll find The Sexy Brutale to be a game that genre fans need to check out.",8
"Mega Man Star Force Pegasus is the proverbial Yin/Yang. The combat - the true essence of Mega Man - is engaging and complex if you want it to be, and can best be described with one word: fun. The battle cards, albeit contrived, add a nice flavor to the game and building your deck to suit your style is quick and easy. But the other side, the story and accompanying cut scenes, have the ability to rip you right out of the game to look for something else to play.",6
"Need For Speed Unbound is easily one of the best racers I’ve played in recent years and a modern highlight of the series. Through great gameplay, a true sense of progression, an engaging visual style, and a well-crafted open world the game manages to cement itself as one of 2022’s most unexpectedly shining stars. A few knocks for cliché story beats, a samey soundtrack, and a few minor bugs shouldn’t be enough to keep players from driving over to the streets to Lakeshore for some stylish, speedy fun.",8
"So. It's GTA. On the GBA. But… it's just not GTA. Not really. Like Max Payne Advance before it, what you're getting is a watered-down experience, but still the closest thing you're going to get on the handheld (if that counts as a plus-point).",7
"Despite the technical limitations, SimCity 2000 remains an enjoyable, challenging way to pass the time. It isn't the direct conversion I'd hoped for, but for twenty bucks, it's plenty sufficient to the task.",7
"As much as I appreciated the shift away from the crime investigation premise of Assassin's Creed Unity, sending Arno on a mere fetch quest turns Dead Kings into the blandest kind of open-world adventure, in which a man who used to be a hero is reduced to a mere errand boy.",5
"Taken as a whole, however, Valkyria Revolution just doesn't come together as well as it should. Between the poor story presentation, AI issues, and numerous superfluous systems that add little to the experience, it feels like the game needed a bit more time and planning for all of its ideas to properly congeal. While Valkyria Revolution offers some enjoyment, you're going to have to wade through the trenches to get there.",6
"Lips: Party Classics doesn’t really do anything to expand the series in any way, but unlike most music games features a track list which is probably one of the best to grace such a game, of course it’s all down to taste but with something on offer to cover most players music choice the game should prove to be a hit at any party.",8
"Age of Empires Definitive Edition manages to fulfill its function as a remaster. The graphics and the sounds are truly a delight, and there are some small playable improvements as well, but these are weighed down by the AI and a pathfinding system which still does not behave as well as it should.",8
"The best atmosphere since the days of Underground and Carbon. We love his visual and sound excesses and all the new ideas (the structure of the story mode, its surprising difficulty and its renewed and slow progression system). Control continues without convincing us (just Heat 2.0), but this is the way. Unbound gives us hope in the NFS saga.",8
"Ghost Song is a very enjoyable addition to the Metroidvania subgenre. It maybe lacks a little bit of originality to help it stand out from its contemporaries in a rather crowded market, but the game does provide a very enjoyable experience. With an atmosphere and story that are haunting and interesting to explore, there are plenty of reasons to delve into the dangerous world of Ghost Song.",8
"Hoshigami Remix isn’t a game we’d recommend for too many players. It can be difficult, complicated, and relatively uninspired when it comes to the overall out-of-battle experience.",6
"Other than the lack of online multiplayer, New Super Mario Bros. Wii is exactly what you want it to be. It’s a great mix of new and old, and though it’s not exactly innovative, playing though the game is just sheer fun.",9
"As a sequel, you’d be hard-pushed to track down a game that is as brilliantly structured, nurtured and evolved as Gears of War 2. With a ruthlessly enthralling pace and variation of set pieces, this is an effortlessly superb package. I haven’t enjoyed a game as much as this since Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, which is surely one of the greatest compliments a title can get.",10
"Calling is an interesting adventure in J-Horror style. There's atmosphere and some nice ideas, although the gameplay is sometimes missing something, and not every situation in the game feels impressive. Worth at least a try, if you're a big horror fan, but don't expect much.",5
"If you're a college football fan, NCAA Football 06 is the game you've been waiting for your whole life. It might even be the best football game ever made, professional or collegiate, which, given the competition for the title, is really saying something.",10
"The consistent delivery of these references complement the story's comedic dialogue and sight gags. You can tell the game's writers are fans of the Police Squad! TV show and movie series. None of the jokes feel forced or drawn out, which helps keep the cutscenes concise and well-paced.",8
"Burning Skies isn't a failure by any means. While the visuals won't sell you on the console's power like Uncharted: Golden Abyss, the campaign is filled with the big boss fights and unique weaponry you expect from the series. As long as you're not hoping for a console-quality multiplayer experience, Burning Skies should satisfy fans.",7
What you see is what you get with the Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection. This includes the touchy controls and difficult AI. These are pure emulations of the very same arcade games that first arrived on the scene almost two decades ago.,6
"Not since ""Zeus: Master Of Olympus"" have the gods smiled so benignly on RTS worshippers, and for new adorers and regular acolytes alike, Age Of Mythology is a revelation &#150; this is a must for followers and atheists alike.",8
"Hell Yeah! certainly stands out enough to be very memorable, but it's also wildly inconsistent. The game starts off strong and there are chunks of fun to be had across the campaign, yet some noteworthy annoyances - including lengthy load times - prevent it from gathering momentum and delivering an all-around satisfying and enjoyable platformer. The potential is clearly there, but not quite fulfilled.",6
"Great gameplay and a humorous, well-written plot are more than enough to help LEGO City Undercover overcome some of the franchise’s lingering technical flaws, making it one of the few worthwhile experiences on the Wii U.",8
"Spilled! is, in sum, an educational game whose ""game"" half doesn't work as well as it should, but it still deserves a fair shot. With the debate around the Earth's health being polarised as it is, it is important that there exist works that aren't afraid to show audiences what a lack of sustainable development does to the place we all live in.",7
"Apart from some death-by-bad-camera-angle moments and a few aggravating perfection-focused “challenge” sequences, Marlow Briggs is enjoyable enough. Just don’t expect to remember any of it next week.",6
"A few hairy moments in, and any attempt to get back under your skin is redundant. Mostly this is because the game's resident evil is largely incapable of harming you, and any sense of jeopardy is lost. [Apr 2010, p.97]",5
It would take ages to explain every element of Gremlins Inc. so I won’t try. My recommendation would be to get it yourself if you’re interested in strategy board games that you can play with your friends.,8
"It’s been twenty-seven years since Cloud, Aerith, and Tifa first left Midgar. Since then, their world — and ours — has changed significantly. It’s such a wonder, then, to be able to recreate that sublime experience of leaving Midgar for the first time during the opening of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. This is the game that delivers on the promise of the Final Fantasy VII remake project. It’s a fascinatingly familiar yet unknown journey that is breathtaking and unforgettable.",10
"Keeping a quick pace helps to emphasise Fallen Legion's strengths and mitigate its weaknesses. There are times where the game's interesting flavour can't quite mask the lack of substance in certain areas, but despite this it remained enjoyable to play throughout. It's certainly a title worth checking out, and should provide a good few evenings worth of entertainment. Plenty of neat ideas and an interesting, if underutilised, world mark a solid debut title for the developer and put it in good standing for future titles.",6
"Persona 4: Dancing All Night is a real party from the beginning to the end. The music is amazing and the remixes of iconic pieces in the series are worth enough to acquire the title just to get them. The design of the interface, characters and stages are a visual delight. If only it had an engaging campaign mode with more depth in the characters it would be a perfect game.",8
"Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth is a phenomenally good video game. It has a habit for self-indulgence, but earns every pause with some shocking story moments, and some of the best combat I’ve experienced.",10
"By building the entire title around only seven mini-games, My Street doesn&#146;t have nearly enough depth to keep players occupied for extended periods of time -- even with online multiplayer support and a great character editor.",5
"It's tough to pull off a survival horror game that doesn't feature much combat, but that's no excuse for making navigation a chore and boring us to death. Wii owners who love pointing their flashlights around in the dark should stick with Silent Hill: Shattered Memories, or visit their local cemeteries after midnight.",5
"Wastelanders won't convince anyone who thought Fallout 76 was irredeemable to begin to believe otherwise, it's simply not enough of a marked improvement to wholesale change many people's minds. For those that left a sliver of a chance for redemption, however, it's one small, wobbly step in the right direction.",6
"Master Detective Archives: RAIN CODE Plus is an absolute blast. Each mystery kept me on the edge of my seat as I franticly tried to solve the case with my team of colorful, though sometimes insane, fellow detectives. There is a lot to love about Master Detective Archives: RAIN CODE Plus, and fans of mysteries and the Danganronpa franchise will fall in love with it.",9
"The game takes the approach of building a relatively small but highly detailed, rigorously simulated world. It prospers with this approach, instead of building a large world and filling it with copy-and-pasted material. Unfortunately, it bogs down often, either due to its poor interface or its puzzles that force you to spend way too much time trying to figure out what the developers where thinking when they designed them. In the end though, the positives outweigh the negatives, making Wuppo a game that is worth playing for the opportunity to explore its beautiful and immersive world.",7
"Dungeon Defenders: Awakened is a fun time, especially with others. But it doesn't have as much content as the game it's remaking yet, meaning that people still playing that one might be reluctant to move onto this version.",7
"There are bad games that anger me, and then there are bad games that just confuse me. Ephemeral Fantasia belongs in the latter column...I'll slide this one in the drawer and forget about it, while most of you shouldn't even give it that much attention.",4
"Diablo 2 Resurrected is what a remaster should be. Vicarious Visions has done an incredible job with what is the cornerstone of the Action RPG genre. A visual gem that still holds against any modern title. The gameplay hasn’t changed an inch, which is what the whole community wanted. More brutal than ever. An isometric Dark Souls to terrorize the new generations of gamers.",8
"The Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth series has always been a potential-filled experience that ultimately disappoints, but the 3rd installment in the series passes right over the endearing and interesting elements of the game’s cut and paste formula for the most boring.",4
"A mediocre and out-of-date tactical game. Stupid AI, lack of immersion and no dynamic campaign or even smoke in the battlefield are not what you would call 'meeting today's requirements'. [June 2007]",7
"While Pikuniku is a light experience, it's got enough charm and verve to stick with you well beyond completion. From Piku's weird wobbly gait and looping jumps in the opening right through to the game's funny, bizarre ending, Pikuniku is more gripping than its simple aesthetic and playful tone would suggest. It'll make you feel like a kid again.",8
"This is Game of the Year material and an exceptional follow-up to a revered first entry. It handles the beloved material with care while still establishing its own new voice, making for a stellar sequel. This is Game of the Year material and an exceptional follow-up to a revered first entry. It handles the beloved material with care while still establishing its own new voice, making for a stellar sequel.",10
"It's Rock Band as usual, but its newly implemented Pro Mode shows that people who have been unchallenged so far can have their share of fun. Bundled with a whopping 2000 songs waiting for you optionally, this game could be worth a sin.",9
"Concord is an enjoyable shooter, kneecapped by a $40 price tag and a bland cast of characters. When it arrives on PlayStation Plus, which feels almost certain at this point, its worth picking up, but only with the enthusiasm you'd treat any other free-to-play fare.",6
"All in all, I'd say Alan Wake's American Nightmare is an easy pick for anyone looking for an action-heavy title with a horror twist. It's got the graphics, it's got the gameplay, it's got the diversity of weapons… all this plus a nice, dark story, for a very reasonable price. If pumping bullets into deadly, frenzied humans hasn't gotten old for you yet, be sure to check this one out.",9
"Hironobu Sakaguchi and Nobuo Uematsu team up again to make a Japanese RPG which can be easily considered one of the best in years. It succeeds in innovating in a lot of features, with a charming gameplay that works and is very fun. It also has an epic and well-told story. A must-have for fans of the genre.",9
"Age of Wonders 4 is a beautifully crafted 4X experience for players who like to dig deep and learn how to customize a game to fit how they like to play and be able to research through many varieties of choices and traits. The game offers some ways to simplify things for those who are more casual but definitely is something that someone could spend hours, days, and weeks digging into and still not be able to see everything the game has in its depths. While its overloaded amount of bookkeeping can prevent some enjoyment, what's here is more than satisfactory for the genre.",7
"As far as 4A Games is concerned, one can only be awe-stricken. With only 10% of the average western developer’s budget, they have managed to publish a stunning game, simultaneously on four platforms. The underdog has triumphed. [June 2013]",9
"A classic returning in a modern guise is never wrong, but technically it is far from perfect. The camera can be very annoying and also the gameplay is sometimes hampered by the difficulty in estimating depth of the levels. Other than that, the gameplay is entertaining enough on its own and the controls are thankfully very fine. A fine remake, but otherwise not very impressive or special.",6
Team Ninja have built upon what was already a solid and addictive foundation with an online integration which makes DoA:U the most complete fighting game package on any platform. [Score with Xbox Live],9
"Another great remaster for one of the most special Nintendo games. Dark, complex and challenging, the sequel to Ocarina of Time has an incredible side-quest system and this version adds some improvements like great 3D effects and better visuals.",10
"Even ignoring all those failings – something at which Dead Island fans will have had plenty of practice – Riptide’s biggest flaw is that it never justifies its existence in terms of plot or new ideas. It’s not simply yesterday’s game, but a time capsule from 2011, a time when zombies weren’t as overplayed and games such as Far Cry 3 and Borderlands 2 weren’t around to cast their long shadows over the action.",3
"The Italian Milestone, starting from a lower budget compared to the giants of the industry, shows a considerable productive effort, clearly infusing all energy in a well built video game.",8
"Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit is a game with an undead, badass bunny as its main character. What more could one want? Seriously, the game is really funny and cool. The style is clearly not for anybody, but if you like that weird, bloody bunny the game will be perfect for you.",8
"Zombie Driver HD plays out like a cross between Grand Theft Auto 2 and Choplifter. Players race around the city picking up survivors and avoiding the zombie hordes. It's a fun game with a surprising amount of content for ten dollars. On the other hand, the missions become a bit tedious by the end. Zombie Driver HD is worth a look!",8
"Mugen Souls is the worst RPG experience I've had in a long time. I like that the game has two different battle systems, I just wish either was fun to use. Neither is able to hold your interest for very long, with one growing tiresome due to needless complexity and the other being too simplistic.",5
"For some, the technical jank may be enough to put them off engaging with Dead or School fully. That’d be a real shame, though; allow yourself to get wrapped up in the narrative, the mechanics, the piles of loot, the beautifully designed stages and the game’s wonderful sense of style, and there’s something truly special to enjoy here; an honest-to-goodness hidden gem if ever there was one.",8
"The more I have played this game, the higher my review score has gone. The farther I got in, the more I enjoyed the puzzles, and the more I appreciated the throwback to the game that started all of this.",9
"If you were to take someone who’s played his share of shooters, someone who cares about the story between and around the shooting, someone who can appreciate games that offer new takes on familiar experiences, Crysis [3] will feel like a soulless blockbuster to the auteur’s art film of Metro: Last Light.",10
"Ray's action focussed levels are great fun and highlight how great the game could have been with a clearer focus. In the end though, the mix of gameplay styles doesn't really work.",7
"Though it does have some solid elements borrowed from the series as a whole, this seems like a rushed title that really does more of a disservice than it does to advances the series.",7
"The pacing is all over the map, and even at its best it feels more inspired than inspiring, if you know what I mean. In spite of the fact that these are remastered versions, they come across very much as creations of their times and places. You may find something to latch onto here, but it’s just as likely that you’ll be turned off.",6
"The First Berserker: Khazan establishes itself as a good soulslike within the immense amount of games that the genre already treasures. It doesn't stand out in some areas, but its addictive combat system makes you forget its stumbles and deeply enjoy its successes.",8
"I honestly wasn’t sure what to expect from B.I.O.T.A. Though it diverged from the Metroidvania genre in some significant ways, I really enjoyed this challenging throwback to games of the past. It marries a compelling and dark sci-fi plot with challenging platforming, fun boss fights, and a vast colony to explore. It’s not a perfect game, and I was definitely frustrated by the many instant death traps, but it’s still a game that retro fans should check out. And that goes double if the game ever makes its way to game consoles.",8
"Character models look alright until they start to move. Everyone seems to have a nervous shake, they constantly move about while they're talking. Someone needs to slip these guys some decaf.",2
"While Sports Bar VR captures the look and feel of a sports bar, the control scheme combined with Hulk Mode made me feel drunk, complete with hangover. The four games on offer are hampered by inconsistent physics, resulting in an unsurprisingly uneven experience. None of that, somehow, interferes with the game being a stupid-fun experience with friends.",6
"Certainly one of the better puzzle games of recent times, I doubt Mario And Donkey Kong will rise to the sort of prominence which inspires expletive-fuelled internet arguments. It will, however, bestow a warm, funny feeling onto those who decide this may be worth a crack.",8
"Rockfish’s take on the space shooter is certainly different, and it’s a refreshing change for the genre. It’s not about exploring the vastness of space in an open world (though jumping into the unknown is certainly still a factor), it’s quite simply an arcade shooter. It’s also a great looking game with an easy to grasp flight model and a mystery waiting to be uncovered. If you enjoy action space sims or rogue-like games such as FTL then you’ll enjoy this. Even if you don’t, there’s a high chance you’ll still enjoy this. Everspace is a cracking game.",9
"I’m used to crafting-themed games being huge, sprawling, self-guided odysseys, so compared to them, Wytchwood is a bite-sized revelation. It’s bleak, it’s funny, and it has character for days. By focusing on the story and puzzles, it creates an item-focused adventure that rarely wastes the player’s time, and then gets out on one heck of a high note. This one is a truly charming adventure that’s as gruesome as it is sweet.",8
"The Definitive Edition of Xenoblade Chronicles successfully elevates this classic to the standards of modern times. The polished graphics, gameplay improvements and new chapter make this remaster worthwhile for returning fans. New players are in for a real treat.",10
"As cliché shooters go, Payback is no ""Black,"" but it's not bad either. If all you're looking for is a predictable, middle-of-the-road shooter - you know, like if you just beat ""Mass Effect"" and want to rent a couple hours of mindless mayhem - you could do better, but you could also do a lot worse.",6
"While there are a couple of problems when it comes to gameplay pacing, This is the Police 2 manages to tell a relevant and enthralling story that stands out within its genre and as better than the original.",7
"A great deal of time devoted to very little gain. Revolution’s lacklustre action RPG gameplay is matched by a nearly complete disregard for building sympathetic characters, who exist to serve an underwhelming narrative. Valkyria Revolution fails on almost every level to recapture the qualities that made its predecessors cult classics.",6
Standing still watching an incomprehensible mass of bodies shifting forwards as they work against the constraints of the engine is no fun. Taking another step into the realms of First-Person shootery and actually firing is inept solace.,2
"Considering it’s a game all about cars and congestion, you’d think Mini Motorways would be a tense and stressful endeavor, but it’s by far one of the most addictingly chill game I’ve played in recent memory. I’m pretty sure it lowered my blood pressure, setting a nice calm mood right before bed. Players expecting a sandbox city planning game will be momentarily disappointed, but after only a few minutes with it, that disappointment will melt away (along with the day’s worries and woes). If you need to relax, like, right now, you must check out Mini Motorways.",8
"Not only are the characters well designed, but once you step out into the huge world, you'll be amazed by the wide array of creatures and landscapes the game has. This is a PS2 game, but it's really pushed to the limits.",10
"The RPG elements do add more to the title. I was starting to get tired of the same old card duel on the Game Boy Advance, now you can have a nice little story to go along with the duels.",8
"An entertaining, challenging, and thoroughly psychedelic music rhythm game that has great audio-visuals. It's a little on the short side at only a couple of hours, but it's a fun game nevertheless.",7
"Forza Motorsport doesn't just straddle the gap between ""PGR2"" and ""GT4,"" it sits perfectly between the two, offering the best of both worlds and rarely puts a foot (or should that be 'pedal') wrong.",9
"It's lighthearted, haunting, soothing, and frenetic. It's too bad that this game is plagued by poor mechanics. The production values are there, but they just can't seem to rise above the glitches.",6
"A good game overall, but with some flaws: a somewhat confusing story and some repetitive moments in gameplay, extending too much some stages. A good option both for younger people and more mature gamers who want a challenge.",7
"A game we've waited five years for should be a masterpiece. At the very least, it should have advanced strategy elements. It would be a much better positioning if the game only came to the tablet.",7
"Grasshopper has made one of their more mechanically satisfying titles, but to enjoy it you have to put up with all of the other muck. You’ll have to choose whether Killer is Dead is the loveless romance for you.",4
"It's safe to say this game has more monkeys than any game other than Ape Escape. These aren't just any monkeys, either. There are zombie monkeys, robot monkeys, mutant monkeys, lab monkeys, disco monkeys, ninja monkeys and plain old throw-feces-at-you monkeys. If you love monkeys, this game is for you.",10
"I see this game as a tech demo of a good physics engine that can be put to a sensible use in some bigger project. The only thing you'll remember having played through Hydrophobia is that water played it's part brilliantly. [June 2011, p.66]",6
You quickly realize that Death Jr. is the right character in the wrong game. The erratic camera control and the resulting difficulty factor stop the game dead in its tracks when it comes to the fun factor.,4
"High Hell is, above all else, a confident game. There isn't anything standing in the way of blasting baddies off rooftops and crashing breakneck through every door in sight, all in acid-soaked neon pink style.",8
"Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition is a triumphant return for a JRPG classic. It doesn't change enough to attract previous doubters, yet enhances the foundations in a number of tremendous ways. It's never looked, sounded or played as good before, meaning it's the perfect time for eager newcomers and familiar adventurers to jump in.",9
"An enjoyable, light simulator. The plane selection (with NATO Fighters mods) makes me feel like a kid in a candy store. I just wish the AI was more challenging and that the multiplayer features were better. I also would not mind having proper labels for improved situational awareness. [Dec 2006]",8
"It's hard to pick out any particular aspect of the game and call it outstanding, but everything in the game just comes together nicely for a fun overall experience. Recommended for most gamers except for bowler-wearing city slickers.",9
Forza Horizon 5 is the best game in the series and the best Xbox Series X/S game to date. Its flawless racing and wealth of activities are backed up by a gorgeous setting and a fantastic new progression system which encourages players to focus on the features they enjoy most. Utterly essential.,10
"Mahjong Cub3d is simply mahjong in fully rotatable 3D. I can tell you that it's easy to get into and control, and that it seems to have this gravitational pull on me as a puzzle game fan. I've always liked mahjong, and this 3D twist on the classic formula makes it even more enjoyable and challenging.",7
"For Rock Band 3, Harmonix revisits its roots to create a risky and adventurous music game that re-blurs the lines between fantasy and reality--but not at the expense of a fundamentally terrific experience that's accessible to most anyone who plays it.",9
"I'm happy to say that Nickelodeon Kart Racers 3: Slime Speedway is the best game in the series so far. Whether you're a nostalgic '90s kid or a modern-day scamp, you're bound to have a tubular time racing with all of these familiar chums.",8
"South of Midnight stands as one of the best story-driven games I’ve experienced in a long time, one that invites deep exploration of its lore and reflection on each character’s journey. Beyond its compelling narrative, the game is simply a joy to play, thanks to its versatile combat and traversal mechanics. For those seeking an immersive story, South of Midnight is the perfect remedy. And with Xbox Game Pass, it’s readily available at your fingertips upon release.",9
"Revita offers a very solid roguelike experience, with a tough but interesting risk-reward system as its hook. The early moments of the game are fraught with uncertainty as very little is explained directly to you, but through trial and error you can gradually figure out how to extend runs and upgrade Memoria Station. Developing the hub area adds to the goals you can accomplish and the loot you can find in each dungeon. That said, there isn't much in the way of permanent stat growth outside of consumable metro tickets you can activate before a run, so it'll take patience, skill, and perseverance to make it all the way through the clocktower, and then again at higher difficulty levels. To make that goal more approachable, though, you can adjust the setting to reduce enemy damage or slow down time. Nonetheless, it will take many hours and many deaths to find every hidden secret and discover all that these darkened subway stops have to offer.",8
"South of Midnight is an early game of the year contender, but that’s not all. It’s one of the best games released in this generation, a game seriously vying for a place on my list of favorite games of all time, and an utter masterpiece that future developers will talk about. At this point, I’m not sure how much more I can really gush about South of Midnight, so please, just play this game.",10
"Nothing needs to be reassessed because nothing has been significantly changed. These are still two charming, well-polished platformers. There’s nothing mind-blowing about them, but I enjoy them for what they are and think more people should experience them. More effort could have been made in this collection, but the graphical clean-up is appreciated. I’m shrugging. You can’t see it, since this is a text review, but my shoulders are up.",7
"Exploring Luna Nova Academy can sometimes be frustrating until you're able to fast travel throughout it, and trying to complete events can often feel like an uphill struggle against the clock. But as you begin to wrap your head around the game's intricacies and balance dungeon crawling with your academic endeavours, things fall into place.",7
"If what Ontamarama was trying to do was advance the music game genre, it sort of has. But, if a sequel can better integrate the two strands of its gameplay, we could have a real hit.",7
"When you play a good game, you always have this itch in the back of your head that keeps you wanting to play it even though you’re doing other things. It keeps on irritating you until you pick up that controller again. It’s very rare for me to experience that when it comes to titles but Tropico 5 is one of them. It’s just that good and addictive.",9
"With over 16 levels, three levels of difficulty, and an engaging plot-oriented story rivaling most in-depth RPG games, Astroy Boy: Omega Factor is highly recommended to all. [Sept 2004, p.92]",9
"It is a pity Ronin struggles with a lot of tiny problems, because the gameplay is pretty awesome. Finding a balance between stealth and action gameplay is hard and it's a real challenge to continue to play this game after a few deaths as the load screen is extremely annoying along with many unnecessary rooms to walk through.",6
"Rather than feeling like a mastermind escapologist, your actual role resembles that of an errand boy collecting the pieces of a pre-scripted plan. Yet while nothing here really shines, the overall package is solid enough to counter our gripes. [Oct 2003, p.114]",5
"An extravagant puzzle adventure combines gambling, carnival and detective story. From all this came an irresistible game full of tension, logical thinking and time shifting. A must-have for anyone who do not mind using a brain while playing.",8
"This timeless classic is back and better than ever. The brilliant combat system fuses side scrolling action with classic fighting games, and together with a branching story system the game keeps you coming back.",9
"From small things like great sound effects and voice acting, to more fundamental victories like its mix of overworld exploration and solid strategy-style combat sections, there’s a lot to love here.",9
"It's a cynical and soulless exercise that deliberately eschews any aspect of modern game design that might make it accessible - like complexity, stylish art direction, and mechanical variety. [Feb 2004, p.78]",3
"Featuring more complex subject matter and a much grittier feel than virtually every other platformer out there, Naughty Dog has fully capitalised on the popularity of 'mature' games by producing a similar title that younger players will legally be allowed to play. But there's something about the GTA-cum-platform gameplay that just doesn't gel. [Nov 2003, p.112]",7
"The performance, happiness and stability issues drag down a game that could have received a perfect score. If I had a choice, I’d roll back to the previous patch to at least have a stable game again, but that’s not an option. Fortunately there are ways to win the game without having a large portion of the map in your back pocket. When the turns are processing, battles are resolved smoothly and revolts remain manageable, Endless Space 2 is an absolutely magnificent game. There is so much to discover, so much to do and so many different ways to do it, it’s dazzling when you get started. But once you have the basics under control and start noticing the many intricate ways in which the game allows you to manage and fine-tune your empire, it is hard not to be impressed.",8
"With a story that is packed with video-game references, humour and interesting characters, Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth3: V Generation is a game that I would recommend to any fan of RPG's. Although it is by no means perfect, this game kept me hooked throughout and I think it is safe to say that I may frequent the world of Nep-Nep more often now that my eyes have been opened to this franchise!",8
I’m so glad that Namco Bandai re-released these games during Klonoa’s twenty-fifth anniversary year. They hold up remarkable well over time and have aged beautifully. I sure hope we see more of Klonoa going forward.,10
"A work of progressive genius that hauls its staid genre up by the bootstraps and takes its place alongside the WOWs and Oblivions of this world. It's altogether too good to be true. [Christmas 2006, p.74]",9
"Lost Records: Bloom & Rage has a premise that's way more interesting than its execution. It draws heavily from the classics of the genre, and in particular from the novel IT by Stephen King, to tell us a story of friendship divided into two timelines: 1995 and 2022, with a great mystery in the background that separated the protagonists, keeping them away from Velvet Cove. The balance between the coming-of-age story and the horror part, however, is totally unbalanced in favor of the former, and the serial writing is not helped by the extended time of the screenplay, with a central part that is too lacking in impact. We will find out on April 15th if the mystery is hidden in the second episode, but for now we are saddened by the wasted potential of this story.",7
"The third Batman game from Rocksteady is an excellent title, undoubtedly the best in studio's history. It impresses not only with beautiful graphics and a dark city, but also due to a great selection of characters and brilliant storyline.",9
"Alwa's Legacy is a lighthearted Metroidvania that's hard to put down once you start playing it. With tight gameplay that features an impressive amount of variety, I certainly recommend picking it up if you love exploring 2D worlds.",8
"If you can't get through your day without a good beat'em up, then maybe Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 is what you need, especially if you want to leave your friends speechless, but there's nothing really new here.",7
"A good game doesn't have to be carefully crafted to be entertaining. As Fuel Overdose demonstrates, sometimes the fun comes from the design mistakes. As a top down racing experience it offers frenetic action at the expense of constant control issues and glitches that promise frustration, but even though the chaos ensures a sense of pleasure since you can mess with everything, everywhere. Sadly, character design and presentation are kind of archaic.",6
"A pleasant surprise in a crowded platforming field. The obstacles present--portals, bounce pads, zip ramps--have all been seen before, but their implementation is anything but stale.",8
"If you’re looking for a song pack then, you could do a hell of a a lot worse than Party Classics, and it’ll probably come out quite a bit cheaper than raiding the DLC store – just keep in mind that’s all your buying.",6
"Darksiders II takes just about everything that was great in the first game and made it better, which is exactly what a proper sequel should do. Even switching to a new character could have spelled disaster, but instead Death casts his shadow to such a degree that you will be saying ""War who?"" before you even leave the Forge Lands.",9
"Its difficulty and niche sensibilities prevent me from recommending it to casual gamers, but those hardcore tacticians with at least 30 hours on their hands will not be able to get enough of it.",8
"The Italians at Milestone prove again that ""two wheeled"" games are their forte. MotoGP 13 is the most realistic and demanding motorcycle game of the past decade and a must-buy for MotoGP enthusiasts.",8
"Alien Swarm is a free game and has been updated regularly to try to iron out the remaining bugs (excuse the pun). All things considered, as it stands the game is a little disappointing and falls short of its true potential.",6
It is a quality experience through and through with some excellent writing and inventive design that I can’t say I’ve ever seen implemented so well in a game before. It dares to be different and does so with style. I loved every minute of it.,10
"We have to admit to being a bit disappointed at how similar Star Force is to the Battle Network games. We were hoping that Capcom would take this opportunity to reboot the series into something fresh. Instead, we have more of a sidestep than a step forward.",6
"Ultimately, The First Berserker: Khazan is a good time. Its aesthetic differentiates it from the plethora of ARPG Souls-likes we've become used to, and its brilliant boss fights are engaging enough to entice you through levels that start to feel boring around the mid-way point of the game. But its lacklustre story and bloated, inconsistent mechanics hinder what could have been a better game if it were more refined.",6
"As it stands, Sports Bar VR is more like a virtual hangout reminiscent of Playstation Home, a social gathering where few patrons indulged in any of the mini-games within and remained content to treat it as a console-based Second Life. It is perhaps for that reason that Sports Bar VR will turn into a cult favorite among early adopters, but for anyone hoping for even a semi-accurate recreation of competitive sports bar activities, they may consider sticking to the real smoke-filled hangouts until a more precise alternative is released.",5
"Nevertheless, Nancy Drew: Deadly Secret of Olde World Park hits the spot surprisingly well, rather than dwelling in ""girly content"" that would've made this game just as insulting as Acclaim's Mary Kate and Ashley line-up.",6
"Mind Control Delete expands on the Superhot universe in every conceivable way. While there’s a lot of fun within its bigger time-manipulating shooter playground, the lofty ambitions result in a unique concept extended beyond its limits.",8
I don't want to ruin things for you but just let me say that I was expecting a better conclusion to wrap up such a memorable series. But as with most puzzle-oriented game it's the journey and not the destination that makes it all worthwhile. And it's been one hell of a good ride.,8
"The graphics are nice, the music is great, and it’s fun to play. The Metroid tie-in actually works quite well in this case to create a richer environment. If you’re looking for something more than pinball, however, you’d best look elsewhere.",7
"Hotline Miami is an odd experience. Missions flow between stealth and combat with split-second tactical choices reinforced through trial-and-error. The context for that gameplay is brutal beyond measure, though the game also provides a rare opportunity for reflection.",8
Persona 4: Dancing All Night is a game I will be constantly going back too. It will fill you with a nostalgic joy if you're a fan of the series but even if you're not there's still a great story and solid gameplay to have fun with.,10
"Ultimately, Compulsion Games has created a love letter to the South, to its beauty and its stories. The dark fairytale we see in South of Midnight is narratively one of the heaviest hitters I’ve played, and that’s something special.",9
"All in all, if you’ve been waiting to play Xenoblade Chronicles for any reason, now is the time to do it. Having never taken the plunge with its initial release on the Wii, or its re-release on the 3DS, the Definitive Edition is just that. It’s a beautiful game with a great story that finally feels like it's found the system it deserves.",10
"Everspace is a refreshing take on the roguelike genre from the creators of Galaxy On Fire. Set up in outer space, players will have to scavenge for resources and fight their way through procedurally-generated scenarios.",8
"A solid fighter, especially if you missed it last year. There was potential to make this the definitive version, but as it stands, it's another quality title for Sony's monster machine, and a worthwhile pick-up you should play.",8
Remixing the episodes into even smaller segments and then populating them with super-powered zombies is the action-packed gauntlet fans of the original Resident Evil never knew they wanted.,8
"The game looks like a mobile game for the little ones, where production chains and military units have been kept to a minimum. Most of the options start and end on a chronic shortage of wood, and food isn't even considered an essential ingredient. [Issue#326]",4
"The best reason to buy Hydrophobia Prophecy - not for entertainment, but as a kind of digital tourism. You're paying for a look at everything the developers achieved over Hydrophobia's exceptionally long development, and to see what this game might have been.",4
"This is not the ultimate karaoke experience that was promised. Changes applied to a great formula will definitely annoy those who love the franchise. Singing in your phone looks cool, when it works, but in terms of content and game modes, it's just a regression. Sad.",4
"A few minor irritations, most notably queuing up production in multiple buildings, don’t do much to mar the overall experience. C&C 3 is a shining example of how fun a five-year-old design can still be if it receives enough polish and tuning.",8
"All of this delightful action and horror comes wrapped in a bone-chilling soundtrack with enough chanting and ""what the hell was that?"" sound effects to sen dyou running for the light switch. [Aug 2002, p.62]",10
"Tries valiantly to weave a tale of political intrigue, but it's undermined by repetitive mission design, poor menus, and an anonymous cast. If you were hoping for a worthy successor to Valkyria Chronicles, you will be sadly disappointed.",4
"Track Lab is a nice music creator game, but you can't create full songs, you can only mix. The creation of samples is interesting and the VR saves the game from being pointless. Without it, the game would lost all of its interest.",5
"In the end, Arkedo has shown up to the party to share with us a huge ball of digital cotton candy; as soon as we get a taste of its ultra-sweetness, it's already evaporating. Fans of the game might counter that there's nothing automatically bad about a trifle of a game, but there's also nothing automatically good about one, either.",4
"Madden NFL 25 is far from the feat, but there is finally an improvement in one important area: gameplay and physics. If this is the way, in the coming years we could see the best version of the franchise in the next years. Of course, the presence of more content is desired, especially in terms of game modes and notable changes in modes such as Franchise and Superstar, but that would be naive knowing the slump from which the IP is emerging. In the end, and just condemning the constant and annoying Ultimate Team ads, we have a good football game for this year's season and that, in this case, is very good news.",8
"The game really demands that you invest a lot of time in it before you see your labour bear significant fruit. Of course, seasoned players coming from previous iterations will be able to pick things up more easily, and this is perhaps who the title is aimed at. Those fans will find much to appreciate, as what F1 2013 does, it does with a great level of detail and precision.",8
"It may be a bit on the short side, especially for players who are able to take down the bosses with relative ease, although most players are probably looking at about six to seven hours of playtime. But in that short amount of time, it manages to pack a satisfying amount of action, tranquility, and exploration into a concise, captivating adventure. Just don't be afraid to dive too deep into the ocean depths, no matter what horrors might lurk in the dark abysses below.",8
"Hitman: Sniper Challenge is a great appetizer for Absolution. In the beginning you may be a bit lost but after a few games you shoot people down like it's your job. You'll become a real hitman and that is perhaps the best thing a game like Sniper Challenge can do. If this quality remains in Absolution, expect great things.",8
"Its elements are very well-executed, though some of the more elaborate encounters can really make the Wii chug. I suspect that experienced role-playing fans will find it a bit on the easy side, but The Last Story nevertheless has plenty of merit, and is certainly one of the better Wii games ever made.",8
"Ultimately, Kung Fu Rabbit just doesn’t cut it in a world where it sits alongside true platforming masters like Trine 2: Director’s Cut and Bit.Trip Presents: Runner 2. It’s cheap, yes, but unless you fancy chewing the cud as a carrot cash-cow, we’d recommend saving your pennies for another day.",3
"Dungeon Defenders: Awakening has had a buggy start, but the foundations here show signs of greatness, and right now it still makes for a bloody good time with a lot of difficulty to get through, which should only get better as the bugs are ironed out and the content increases.",7
"25th anniversary of Klonoa brings the long-lost series back to our cozy game libraries and gives us chance to defeat nightmares of Phantomile and Lunatea once more. Klonoa and his friends look in 4K and 60FPS more beautiful than ever and the remastered textures, sounds and this 2,5D experience will bring nostalgic tears to your eyes. However, 25 years of technological advance has shown its toll on the game and sometimes you will have to push through some not very pleasant moments.",8
"It's much too easy, the gameplay is much too basic, and the graphics are just bad. Also it has pretty crummy unlockables for the most part, unless having a sound test feature that takes a bit of effort to get makes you happy.",6
"With its streamlined interface and modern makeover, AoM is itself a mythical beast: a sequel that's simultaneously deeper and more accessible than its predecessor. [10 Jan 2003, p.76]",10
"A card-based choose your own adventure game that emulates your favourite board games, Foretales has a novel gameplay idea that sadly gets a little too repetitive to hold your attention for the multiple playthroughs its story options offer. It’ll make for a warm and comforting couple of sessions play and there’s a lot of scope for an expanded sequel, but what’s here may leave you wanting even after just one playthrough.",6
"Extends the tradition of complex strategy with infinite replayability that the series is known for. It is the perfect blend of RPG and turn-based strategy, giving players that like a personal relationship with the characters as well as those that simply enjoy sending nameless masses to their death something to love.",8
"Dicefolk is a roguelite that gives us power over randomness. We roll the dice, analyse the available moves and choose what our team will do as well as the opposing team. By playing on both sides of the fence, we can create more elaborate and fun strategies to field. Dicefolk is suitable for those who want to be challenged but also those who prefer not to play dozens of hours without gaining a single victory.",8
"Pac-Man World Re-Pac is a revived, gratifying 3D platformer that any fan of the genre should consider picking up. Its consistently engaging level design, well-implemented difficulty, and unique boss battles provide a rewarding experience. Even when considering some level design oddities, there are no vital drawbacks to embracing this delightful journey. Here’s hoping the sequel receives similar treatment.",8
Short but extremely tough add-on to the kingdom sim may address devotees of the original game but brings no better playability or improvements except for the map editor. [Issue#191],5
"Yonder offers a beautiful world and a big heads-up to the bigger franchises of this planet. The fact that only three people developed it, make this game very special. It is too bad the search for Sprites is exhausting, cause otherwise this could have been a pretty awesome game.",6
"With a little more refinement, Ronin could easily have been an enjoyable romp. It certainly looked the part and in the initial stages was a slick action platformer, but by the time the game reaches its conclusion, there’s little motivation to continue. It may be short, but finishing Ronin feels like running a gauntlet by the skin of your teeth.",6
"I liked playing Knights and Bikes, but more for the look, the feel and the charming story than for the actual gameplay. It was hard not to like and begin to really care for Nessa and Demelza, who seemed to have all the many-faceted qualities of real kids. It had a nice soundtrack too. Knights and Bikes may not be an epic AAA game but it has some originality and fun to offer nonetheless. Strap on your helmet and take a relaxing ride with two quirky kids whose touching friendship will take you back to your own youthful innocence.",8
"What Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth does is challenge the idea that FF7 can't be topped within its own in-game universe; in my eyes, that's already been done, in the middle game of a trilogy no less, and now we'll just have to wait and see if Square Enix can stick the landing on what's been an incredible, must-play two-parter thus far.",10
"Ninja Theory shattered any doubt of its ability with a genius reinvention of Devil May Cry, but their talent with DLC may be questioned after Vergil's Downfall, a brief story that expands on the past of Dante's brother with not so much glamour. There is a handful of missions, each lasting no more than 20 minutes and the cinematics look underdeveloped. For its quality, this piece of downloadable content is not worth the price.",7
"Just average. There's almost no diversity in available forces, and very few things are upgradeable. The graphics are fair, but are blown out of the water by recent entries. Sound is tolerable, but just there as filler.",5
"A decent add-on pack, but one that has a rather sub par song selection and absolutely no new features of note. New players should definitely stick to the original game, though this does act as a rather cheap DLC pack for those people desperate for some new material.",7
"New Allies is pleasing to look at and offers a relaxed experience for newcomers, as long as you keep your expectations in check. But if you are looking for a deep city builder or a long-lasting multiplayer strategy game, by all means, look elsewhere.",5
"What the game suffers from is an overwhelming lack of personality. The vehicles are generic looking, even for the future, and the rest of the game feels as empty as the abandoned cities the tracks encircle.",6
"Xenoblade Chronicles is as grand and all-encompassing as Xenoblade Chronicles 2, and this Definitive Edition presents a wonderful remaster of an already excellent RPG. From the expansive and gorgeous worlds to explore to the memorable story and the stellar soundtrack.",9
"Bellator MMA Onslaught is a failed attempt to propose a complex discipline as mixed martial arts in digital delivery, renounce to include a variety of feature that would be crucial for its success.",5
"Jurassic World Evolution: Complete Edition comes to the Nintendo Switch, bringing with it a ton of DLC and the ability to play on the go. Rest assured, all of the magic from the original game has been left intact.",9
"It's imaginative, it controls well, and the puzzles are solid and challenging without being repetitive. It's simply that a basic weakness in the engine makes The Haunted Mansion a far more frustrating experience than it really needs to be.",8
"While Venetica is completely playable, I never would have beaten it without a review assignment. Gamers deserve a little more incentive than the bare pleasure of leveling up and hoarding loot to no real end. Even if that's your only ambition, there are much more attractive and fun venues for it. The developers seem to have infused Venetica with at least a portion of their hearts, and I hate to see passion so wasted. Then again, I could be wrong, and Venetica is the dreary result of pure industry.",6
"The game's long-term entertainment value is tied up in multiplayer, and while I'm confident the user-generated tracks will always yield new and interesting experiences, playing with other players won't so much.",8
"Boyfriend Dungeon is a good dating sim held back to being something truly great by its curious choices and lite dungeon-crawler elements. While you may not get the deepest rogue-like experience in-game, you will be satisfied by some of the intense, hot (and maybe even cute) relationships on offer. Just tread careful ground if you’re sensitive to some of the themes that the game is exploring. Regardless, some good and disposable fun can be had smashing some monsters and pashing some cuties. Delve on.",7
"Sine Mora EX is a great way to revisit an outstanding shoot em up. The time mechanics still provide a lot of fun, and the amount of content is more than fair. It also looks better than ever, but the new modes and multiplayer options leave much to be desired.",8
"Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is frankly a weird game, one that's not so easy to crack: excessively built around an eventually underwhelming concept, you'll never truly hate it, but you won't either love as much as you'd like to.",8
"Gears of Wars 2 is what epic masterpieces are made of and on top of that it raises the bar for all action games on the Xbox 360. It’s an over-the-top, action junkie’s dream come true that easily surpasses the much-loved original that still haunts the dreams of all Xbox owners.",10
"A truly deep and compelling 4X game that will keep players busy for hours. What it's lacking in ability to pick up and play, it makes up for by delivering a beautiful experience for those who are willing to keep at it until they understand it all.",8
"Need for Speed Unbound is a refreshing entry in the franchise, with new visual effects that enhance its sense of style. But for all the good that it does, it commits the cardinal racing game sin by periodically forcing the player to slow down, resulting in a fun, but mixed gameplay experience.",7
"Close to the Sun is great at atmosphere-building, but the ending is nothing short of disappointing: too many big questions are left unanswered, as if developers couldn’t bring themselves to choose one version of the events over all others.[Issue#238, p.64]",7
"Simply put, the control of DJ should’ve been left to the directional pad, the camera should’ve been centered to the nub, and the weapon select should’ve been placed on a subscreen accessed by the start or select buttons.",6
"Endless Space 2 is one of the very best 4X games money can buy, specially if you like space related stuff. The only drawback is the lack of accessibility for newbie players who might find it hard to get aboard.",8
"If you consider yourself ""fairly interested"" in racing and motorsport, you are probably better of with NFS:SHIFT or Race Driver: GRiD. But if you are a direct-injected, turbo-aspirated pedal-to-the-metal-Petrolhead, this might just be the perfect Racing-Sim for you... that is, if you don't already own GTR Evolution, which offers more content whilst not falling short in any other term.",8
"If you've already sampled the mesmeric magnificence of either of the PSP versions, or of the Xbox Live version, or of the mobile phone version, you won't be surprised, or challenged, by anything included here.",7
"What doesn't work this time out is Throttle Monkey mode, Atari's way of separating the casual from hardcore gamer. In other titles speeded-up gameplay can be an endurance test; here, it's just unplayable.",4
"Forced Showdown is a clever little game that skillfully mixes action elements to a card game core, providing a lot of fun. Only the lack of any multiplayer mod is a real drawback. If you're a solo player you won't regret spending your money.",8
"Several dozen unlockable outfits can be mixed and matched at your leisure to create the silliest looking avatar imaginable, and the longer arcade shooters from the first game return as brief alternatives to the more frantic minigames.",8
"Need for Speed Unbound is what we all needed. In a world full of racing games trying to be the next iRacing or a sim in general. Unbound says, ‘Hey, I’m really just here to have a damn good time,’ and hands you the keys.",10
"This Re-Pac of that game that had a moderate success more than twenty years ago proves to be mostly aimed at nostalgics of the original title, eager to get their hands on one of their first playful experiences on the historic PlayStation, which can therefore be satisfied from the new Bandai-Namco proposal. Those who have not already felt an immeasurable affection for Pac-Man World for some time will not find in the Re-Pac a useful reason to rediscover this little gem of the past, yet another demonstration of how much the world of video games has evolved since that distant 1999.",6
"Overall Saturnalia works and manages to excite until the end, thanks above all to its open structure, which makes the story replayable several times without ever appearing heavy or too repetitive.",8
"If you want something deep, different and definitely fun to dip into for a bit, this is one I’ll recommend all the way to the bank, where I will then play a card to steal all your money and ascend to gremlin godhood atop my never-ending pile of cash.",9
"Strikeforce serves as a refreshing direction for the series, one that will that will no doubt attract a few new fans. However, it can be unfairly punishing, so make sure you’ve got some mates to lend a hand.",7
"While Camina Drummer may not have been the captain of the ship at the start of the mission, she absolutely takes the reins by the end. Telltale has stepped it up in terms of both visual quality and game play, with a solid yet short intro to their take on a gripping sci-fi narrative. The true depth of which however remains to be truly tested going into further episodes as the narrative progresses.",8
"As a fighting game, it's a quite simple experience, but the franchise it is based on will make it a very interesting choice for its fans. However, its simplicity may end up boring us.",7
"The Big Con is ultimately about its story, though, and it's a story that mostly works despite an inescapable sense of familiarity. There aren't many beats here that you haven't seen before, and while that lends the closing hours the feeling that expected pieces are simply falling into place, the game has enough verve and style that it manages to hold it together. The writing isn't especially funny or clever, but there's enough personality in the art style and story conceit that I was still entertained for the bulk of the six hours that I spent with it.",7
"Boxboy is a fun and addictive puzzle game that is certain to keep players around it for some time, not just because of its mechanics but also because it introduces new ideas and challenges at a very high pace. It only suffers from its washed away visual style, which could have used more work, even for a game of this genre.",8
"We don't have Bloodborne on PC, but we do have Hunt the Night, its Zelda-infused, pixelated version. Even in its current form where there are some difficulty spikes it's a game that will please those who love difficulty and challenge.",8
"The game is a little on the easy side. Ok, a lot on the easy side if you&#146;re good with puzzles but not too hard for kids and of course it suffers the fate of all puzzle games; When you&#146;ve solved them once, there is no challenge in solving them again.",7
"The newest Super Monkey Ball game isn't lacking for much. With a ton of remastered levels, modes, minigames, and unlockable prizes, this enormous package could keep a fan busy for the rest of their life - if they don't mind high blood pressure. The only thing more pervasive than the mountain of content is the franchise's usual blistering difficulty. Fun, frustrating, and rewarding, this is a great collection.",8
"An outstanding improvement on a stale series. There’s still room for improvement; a few more fatalities would have been nice, and more detailed arenas to fight in would take the game up a level.",8
"While its RPG aspirations may be overshadowed by your need to constantly source the basics like ammo and health, The Pit--with its random elements and permadeath--is justified in its boast of replayability, even if it is only out of necessity. [May 2013, p.61]",7
"Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes is now a solid fantasy 4X game with plenty of mechanical depth for those who delight in tweaking parameters, if still lacking that certain spark to elevate it into the top tier of the genre.",8
"The graphics aren't the greatest, the core gameplay doesn't deliver great innovation, but there are so many game types, mini games, and little pieces to play with that it doesn't seem to matter. You'll have fun, whether you intended to or not. [Apr 2005, p.86]",8
"Stacked against the genre's competition, this game was scraped from the bottom of the barrel, but if what you want is a straight-forward, good-looking destructo-fest, ""B!GE"" should be considered.",6
"Sorry We’re Closed is an incredible debut from á la mode games. It dares to go where scarce horror games have gone prior in making their underworld adventure also dreamy, poppy and dripping in substance. The world of demons and angels is tantalising in writing and worldbuilding but also visual design, depicted as god-like otherworldly hotties. Thankfully that substance isn’t skin deep and also translates to inventive horror gameplay design where you’re constantly shifting between claustrophobic fixed camera positioning for arena fights and first-person mode for lining up crunchy shotgun blasts. All these moving parts make for a memorable adventure filled with exciting boss fights, wicked needle-drop moments mid-battle and deep discussions on love and relationships. Quite simply the coolest survival horror game to ever exist, Sorry We’re Closed is certifiably one for the girlies.",9
"An excellent expansion that does exactly what an expansion pack should do -- add in new stuff while improving the core gameplay. The game remains a bit over- reliant on micromanaging special powers and hero units, but for fans of The Battle for Middle-earth II's gameplay style, the expansion pack is a must buy.",8
"Curse Naughty Dog for creating what is - at times - an almost unplayably hard game, but if you can dig deep into your well of persistence and climb this mountain of a game, you'll get a great view of the most involving, rewarding and momentous platform game ever created.",9
"Sorry We’re Closed struck me deep. Every confession of love, every bullet through the heart, every day that Michelle woke up just to prove love is worth living for. Any kind of love, as long as you try. That’s the kind of game this is. Past the combat and puzzles, after the decisions and conversations. No matter what, it wants you to wake up each day and choose love.",9
"Close to the Sun’s art direction, themes, and basic ideas are going to draw many in, but once the story gets started and the gameplay fails to advance, they’ll be trying to jump overboard.",5
I was disappointed that The Great Escape opted for a more conventional action-game route rather than challenging the player through a sim-like game of socially-based puzzle solving. But it's still a game that is varied and sophisticated enough to be fleetingly fun and worthwhile for any fan of the film.,6
"In our opinion Madden NFL 10 is possibly the best ever American football game ever to grace a console, thanks to the work the team is making every year to improve on the formula. Improvements are subtle, but constant with each release.",8
Resident Evil Revelations 2 strikes the perfect balance between new and old. Returning plot threads and the emphasis on ammo management will please franchise veterans while anyone can appreciate the thrill of intimate monster encounters and distressing boss battles.,8
"There's the excellent AI, providing plenty of intense situations wherein you must outwit your enemies. The intelligence of the game&#146;s often tricky challenges make their completion all the more rewarding.",7
"The story may not wow you with its political trappings, but Raiden's transformation and the gameplay that springs from it are the most alluring reasons to give him another shot as the leading man. If you're even vaguely interested in the Metal Gear series or intelligent hack and slash games, do not pass up a chance to play this exciting and addicting hybrid.",8
"Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit has its flaws with its unresponsive controls and repetitiveness. However these small flaws can easily be overlooked when you look at what all Hell Yeah! has to offer with its exquisite graphics, entertaining gameplay, fun music and nonstop humor.",8
"While not a high water mark for pinball games, Zen Pinball 3D delivers on every one of its promises. This seven dollar 3DS game features four exciting stages, online leaderboards and an achievement system that will keep you coming back for more.",8
"Despite the possibilty of too much repetition or worklike feeling, EF brings the first true traditional RPG to the PS2. The story is interesting, the mini-games unique, the characters vivid and the locations fascinating.",6
"Unfortunately, my impressive creation was forced to engage in mundane missions and unexciting encounters - it was like watching Superman pay bills or walk the dog. [Apr 2004, p.98]",6
"Trek to Yomi raises the bar high for historical accuracy. It's clear how hard the developers worked to make this game feel like an act of love and admiration for the Edo period of Japan. However, the well-written story, great voice acting, and beautiful set pieces are held back by the combat.",8
"The single-player game will last the average gamer no more than 10 hours, after which your only option will be to repeat it in order to improve your score, or find some friends who also have a copy of the game so you can compete in the multiplayer matches.",7
"Pikuniku is an odd game, yes, but it is a fun, relaxing one to boot. There are few better ways to spend an afternoon than in its colorful, quirky world. It may not be long but you’ll have a big, dumb smile on your face the whole time; a pure realization of quality over quantity.",8
Moons Of Darsalon can be a fantastic game at times. Offering a fresh spin on a subgenera that often times feels stale and unenjoyable. However there are times that it can fall prey to the same troubles that other similar games have. With the AI being brain dead to the point that it makes the game unplayable. And the challenges on some levels feeling a step too far too soon. And the decision to include AI-Art when they already had decent artwork made will never stop feeling odd to me.,7
"Yonder: The Cloud Catcher Chronicles has an earnest heart and an anxious mind. Brilliant landscapes and gorgeous vistas create a waking daydream while economic riddles and perfunctory direction recall the drag of reality. Yonder's strides, despite an admirable form, don't seem to take it anywhere.",6
"Rollerdrome immediately clicked with me, and I ate it all up. As polished and fun as the experience is, it feels like Roll7 is just dipping its toes into the water. I hope this talented studio gets the chance to make a sequel to further flesh out this unique concept with more detail in the story and greater player progression. Regardless, Rollerdrome is a fantastic first foot forward. I adored the campaign gameplay and have a feeling my friend group will use this unique title for late-night scoring competitions.",8
"There’s not enough here beyond simple questions and answers to hold your attention for long, and that makes the game’s tedious pace drag on even worse. Get yourself some Trivial Pursuit and the drink of your choice for a far more enjoyable evening than this.",5
"With about triple the number of mini-games, or a budget price launch, we'd probably recommend it as a quirky curiosity/novelty purchase, but if we have to hear another squeaky kid utter the word 'like', we'll probably self-combust.",4
"After the marvel of the beautiful graphics and a first moment of thought that surely emerges about Rae's condition, there isn't really very much that remains for long after the short experience of Beyond Eyes.",7
"It’s certainly easy for basically anyone to craft a simple beat in Track Lab, but someone looking for anything more advanced would be better spending their time in a program like GarageBand. For VR junkies, the prospect of becoming a virtual DJ is certainly appealing, but a game with pre-selected and popular song clips like Electronauts will be a lot more satisfying and a lot less time-consuming.",6
"To my immense surprise, I haven’t fallen for a Zelda game like this since I played the The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (1991). Evidence of master craftsmanship is everywhere in this game. By the time you’re flipping a temple upside down then right side up, you may discover that your imagination has been enlarged.",10
Alan Wake's American Nightmare is highly entertaining and has an interesting twist that ought to be fleshed out into a full-length game. In other words this is an excellent appetizer until we get the real sequel. Hopefully this won't take too long.,8
"Throne and Liberty is a free game that is worth trying out. Its translation into Spanish, constant updates in the future, tons of content for all types of players and the possibility of making great friends make it a title that can offer hundreds of hours of fun without spending a cent. On screen it looks spectacular at all times and the frenetic pace of each event provides a differentiating touch that makes it unique. There are other similar games in this sense but none as big as Throne and Liberty. However, the auction can slow down players both when it comes to acquiring items or equipment as well as completing some challenges.",8
"Shulk and his friends are unwavering in their optimism and integrity, and they make for a charming and endearing cast with a story that never fails to move and grow. Certain mechanics are a bit confusing and overwhelming to learn, but overall, Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition hits the nail on the head in almost every way and adds up to a beautiful adventure that thoroughly deserves your time.",9
"Tape 1 of Lost Records introduces us to a charming group of characters and presents an intriguing story that sets up a lot of questions and mystery for Tape 2, but a ton of technical issues and awkward dialogue really hamper the overall experience for the first episode of this two part adventure.",6
"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth defies all expectations and is the new benchmark for what a remake should be. Bold and unapologetic with something to say but also true to its roots. I've loved, I've laughed and I've cried while playing this game and if you fall into the right crowd, you very will too. Provided is an unforgettable journey, a magnetic cast, and a world that is magic and an experience that is transcending. From combat to graphics to music to side activities to writing to performances, Rebirth is one for the books and I can't wait to see where we go from here.",10
"The mix between Pokémon-like gameplay and the movie itself doesn't work out well. Sadly, the developers haven't put much effort into this game, because the potential would have been great.",7
"The fact that it's simplistic means that it's easy to jump into and have fun with, and the length of the game is just right - not too long to make the experience a bore, but not so short that you felt cheated of your money.",8
"A plain, formulaic MMORPG with minimal inspiration, originality, or genre innovation. If you’re in dire need of a new MMO and can tolerate aggressive monetization, it might be worth a shot—it works fairly well mechanically and is free-to-play at its core. However, be prepared for a lack of content and the nagging sense that you’ve played something just like it a hundred times before.",5
"When I read that Crusader is slowly becoming the game the developers wanted it to be, I can’t hold back laughter. What are they going to do in Crusader III? Strip the visuals of distinctiveness even more? Simplify the economy further? Remove some more units? [Dec 2014, p.81]",4
"Touts a few appreciable improvements over the last Yu-Gi-Oh! card battle game for the GBA, which will probably be enough to win the favor of hardcore Yu-Gi-Oh! fans, but casual card battlers who already have one of the other Yu-Gi-Oh! collectible card games for the GBA can safely skip this one without missing too much.",6
"The game may tease you, exhaust you, and possibly destroy you with its boss encounters and awful forced stealth level, but it all builds toward a focused, dark vision unlike much else in the medium.",7
After Us combines unique environmental design with fast and dynamic gameplay with many secrets to discover and a powerful social message. Only a few design decisions and poor performance tarnish the final result.,8
"Dead Cells is a deliriously good time whatever console you play it on, but the instant-on, play-anywhere nature of Nintendo Switch is a particularly comfortable fit for a game played in short, frenzied, fatal bursts.",8
"But for my money, it's time well spent, as it succeeds more often than not in recapturing the spirit of some of the more highly regarded CRPG titles of the earlier part of the decade.",8
"Mario & Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games is exactly what it says it is: an Olympics game with Mario and Sonic. While it is fun, it doesn’t necessarily do anything past entries didn’t do. That’s not necessarily a bad thing though, because overall it is a fun formula, despite some of its flaws.",7
"Traditional ""hardcore"" gamers won't get the most out of Labo unless they're willing to massively step outside of what is their gaming comfort zone, while creatives, musicians and children will find so, so much to do and enjoy. But regardless of your playstyle or preference, I can heartily recommend trying Nintendo Labo when you get the chance to put your hands on it. Playing it is fun, everything works, but the satisfaction of building your own peripherals is entirely unique.",8
For true fans this title could be a no-brainer – it’s Metal Gear. More casual fans can rest easy that you really don’t have to know much about the series at all to enjoy this one. Both will have to weigh if that short of a run time warrants the cost.,9
"As good as the single-player campaigns are, the multiplayer capabilities are where the game really shines. Going head-to-head against a human opponent doesn't involve a storyline, but victory is always more satisfying against a real person than against a computer opponent programmed to perform at ""normal"" difficulty levels.",9
"Yonder: The Cloud Catcher Chronicles is a fun, friendly and visually stimulating sandbox with a world that invites you to relax and have fun. But the lack of variety in the chores to do, through simplistic and not very deep mechanics, ultimately affects the game in a negative way.",6
"At the end of the day, despite all of its flaws, B.I.O.T.A. is a game about vibes. It's about that feeling of playing games as a kid, those cozy times when everything was so simple. Sure, it's not the most complicated game ever, but I don't think it's trying to be. Above all, this game has heart. It's far from perfect, but what game is? In spite of a multitude of issues, there's a certain charm to the whole project that I can't help but feel enamored by. I look forward to seeing what Small Bros works on in the future.",7
"Next time, hopefully Fuse will go easier on the mini-games. We'd rather have a character-based game that's great at pinball rather than a fence-riding jack of all trades that is master of none.",7
"Dynasty Warriors Strikeforce tries to refresh the saga but a new online mode is not enough to do that. Srikeforce is a hack 'n slash with only one purpose: slash furiously between ranks of defensless enemies pushing only the same two buttons. Playing with a friend may be funny, but the solo mode soon become boring.",6
"Thankfully, we all know it is not the graphics and sound that makes a game. The actual gameplay for RGA is some of the best I have experienced of the dozens of racers that are available for the GBA.",8
"Overall, NBA 2K23 has some of the best gameplay in an NBA 2K game. While the MyPlayer mode is a bit of a shadow of its former self, the various additions and changes to MyTeam and MyNBA make up for it overall. Despite being on point in most areas, the Virtual Currency situation will definitely affect players’ enjoyment of the game. While the term “pay to win” does come to mind, NBA2K23’s gameplay and various modes are still very well done.",8
"Lost Records: Bloom & Rage Tape 1 kept me interested throughout, though its heavy focus on character moments got in the way of forming a more cohesive main plot. I’m hopeful that all of the setup that’s been done will allow Tape 2 to fully explore the mystery behind Bloom & Rage’s ‘wild’ summer of 1995.",6
"Nintendo Labo might seem like a gimmick - and it is, to a certain extent - but there’s far more it than at first meets the eye. It’s a collaborative concept as rewarding in its construction as it is in its final result (much like any LEGO build you’ve ever worked on), and one that utilises every facet of Switch’s DNA in a way only Nintendo could pull off. With the unbound potential of Toy-Con Garage at its heart, Nintendo Labo mixes the physical and digital so seamlessly even its hefty price tag shouldn’t put you off.",8
"A passable Wii sporting title that brings a few backyard favorites to your living room. Unfortunately, the imprecise controls don't let the game achieve its full potential. Consequently, the title is nothing more than a bit more fodder for Sony and Microsoft fanboys to point their fingers and laugh at.",6
"If you've grown tired of having your hand held through tutorial after tutorial, and incredibly easy arcade racers, the challenge offered by Unbounded is sure to appeal to you. I've definitely found myself enjoying this title a lot more than I would have anticipated, and urge racing fans to check it out.",8
"A Space for the Unbound is an incredibly touching story that will keep you guessing until the very end. With beautiful pixel art and a fantastic soundtrack, this is a game you don’t want to miss.",9
"You’re in the Movies is a neat little party game; it offers plenty of fun in short bursts, however, don’t expect your guests to be amused for long periods of time as the movies and mini games are just slight variations of one another.",7
"The combat and chat systems seem to be adequate, and the experience apparatus will satiate the level-hounds out there; but all told, Shadowbane is decidedly average. [June 2003, p.117]",7
"Armored Core 4 delivers more of what the series is known for: fast-paced, arcade-style mech action with highly customizable robots in which to fight. It does this with some very nice visuals to boot, although it fails to be really great with the extremely short campaign, forgettable missions/story, and a clunky user interface for the garage and shop.",8
"You are not bound by fantasy stereotypes or archetypes, and can thus create often very bizarre combinations of races and their elements. It's a brilliantly done system, and one on which the authors will be able to build all their major or minor DLC for a few more years if sales are good. In an age of games as services, one couldn't ask for more from a solid strategy game. [Issue#327]",10
"Obliterating futuristic forces and corporate landmarks with upgradable lightning, earthquake, and tornado attacks could've made for some stunning natural fury. But you'd never know it from Elements' main campaign, which spans 90 tepid minutes.",4
"There are some fun gameplay ideas in the DS version of Quantum of Solace, but the execution plainly leaves too much to be desired. The cutscenes artificially connect the missions together, and the story makes little or no sense. The game, at various points, is either too easy or too hard, and its only real challenge comes from the inaccuracy of all its gameplay elements.",6
"The lack of interactivity and emotional involvement, the ease with which the few hours of play are dealt with and the almost total absence of replayability unfortunately prevent the Italian studio from flying high towards the sun.",5
Theatre of War ultimately ends up being a “nice try”. There is too little feedback and too little variety for its size to recommend it to hardcore wargamers and it’s too frustrating on too many levels to recommend to the neophyte.,7
"Old Moon’s Ghost Song has all the markings of a good metroidvania game, literally giving a tip-of-the-hat to the Metroid series, and works to make the experience deeper than a replicated version of a Nintendo classic.",8
"Ghost Song is a love letter to metroidvania genre with a huge map, so big that even the portion that can be immediately visited could almost represent a complete game. The game features an excellent graphic design, albeit with improvable animations, and an interesting story to follow despite starting with a little delay. The soulslike component makes things as hard as expected, and while it might annoy players who don't like repeating the same section again and again, it's part of the game. Definitely recommended for those who love exploration, too bad for the limited support for keyboard / mouse combo.",8
It's slightly dazzling that the best Wii game of 2009 is based on a formula from 25 years ago. However it's used imaginatively and the new multiplayer mode is great fun. The tight controls and challenge of yesteryears are still charming. [Dec 2009],9
"While the visuals make decent use of the DS hardware, the gameplay is very basic and gets repetitive even after a short period. There are a few moments of fun such as when you’re cooking, but otherwise, there’s nothing overly impressive about Ratatouille.",6
"Rather short (about 10 hours to finish the main story), Wytchwood is a very good crafting game with a fantastic art direction and an excellent soundtrack promoting relaxation. The puzzles and fights present may not be complex enough, but the whole thing is lifted by finding different resources in various biomes and crafting unique items.",8
"Rogue Heroes: Ruins of Tasos is a fantastic Zelda-inspired, procedurally-generated, action-adventure with one of the most rewarding gameplay loops I’ve seen in some time. It perfectly captures the styles of its inspirations, while carving its own legacy as a standout Roguelike. I honestly enjoyed every second of my time with Rogue Heroes and can’t wait to continue playing in the coming weeks.",9
"Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is an impressive showcase for the Vita. Its sharp colors pop off the screen, and it controls better than ever thanks to the system's d-pad. If you love the game, or the series in general, this is a must-buy and delivers the goods in every way. However, if you've already got a console version, you might want to wait for a price drop since this is presently priced the same and can't be played on the big screen.",9
"No doubt it would have been interesting to see some alternate take or variations in this remaster, perhaps in a secondary ‘modern mode’ with streamlined controls, updated AI, and less tech-tree clutter. But as a reasonably priced remaster that doesn’t mess with the original apart from implementing some minor improvements and all the bug fixes and content that came with later expansions it’s hard to fault Age of Empires: Definitive Edition. A fun, engaging trip down RTS memory-lane.",8
"It adds a wealth of new content to the game, not just around the water theme but in other areas as well. RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 feels more complete and polished with the expansion.",8
"Lots of one-liners, lots of humor, and a healthy dose of action. The story isn't an epic masterpiece, it's an Evil Dead plot. It's nowhere close to being the best, but it sure is fun.",6
"Valkyria Azure Revolution is the spin-off no one was waiting for. Every component which made the Valkyria Chronicles saga so famous is absent from this bad ""sequel"". The graphics look awful on PS4, the casting is generic at best and its action-RPG mechanics are some of the worst we've ever seen in the last decade. Why would an action-RPG make you pause the game every time you want to use a skill? Why, SEGA ?",4
"EA Sports FC 25 follows in the footsteps of its predecessor, adding a number of welcome details such as the arrival of women in the career mode and the rush mode, not forgetting the roles that add an ever more tactical edge to your matches. However, the experience is spoiled in part by the many problems that remain, which can clearly discourage many. In the end, we wouldn't recommend the version as it stands, given that it's more of an update to FC 24 than a new game in its own right. Prefer a console version if you really want to buy it.",8
"Just remember to keep your expectations in check: Final Fantasy XIII-2 isn't a timeless adventure in the grand tradition of the beloved series. But if you're curious to see the next stage in this ongoing tale, there's no reason you shouldn't chase after Lightning. After all, she can't defeat Caius without you.",8
"Apart from its frightful visuals and clanky controls, Those Who Remain is a somewhat interesting experience. The protagonist is literally asked to shed the light on its past as he plods through the ominous city of Dormont. Quite short though, the journey of Edward might give some cold sweats to the most fearless players.",6
"Hunt the Night is a great example of what a first-time developer can accomplish. It ticks almost all of the expected boxes, while nailing the balance and cohesion between its melee and ranged fighting techniques, and how one relies on the other. The game is a solid challenge, particularly in its boss fights, without ever feeling unfair. The times it doesn’t fully score a win at least show enough potential to hint at what could have been. Its relatively short runtime offers a tight and enjoyable experience that could do with a little bit more content and world-building to iron out the well-intentioned content provided. With a very solid presentation backing it up, it’s an easy recommendation for dark action RPG fans.",7
"An abundance of various modes and improvements to the on-court action, NBA 2K23 is an astonishing amount of fun for any basketball fan. Even the microtransactions in some modes weren’t enough to dampen the pure fun that the rest of the game had to offer.",9
"Cube Life: Island Survival fills a gap in the Wii U's catalogue and that is something to praise. At the same time, the games's own shortcomings and flaws make other gaps which, according to producers Cypronia, will be corrected soon. This is absolutely necessary, since Cube Life, as it is, does not go far enough to become a significant title in the Wii U's library.",5
"The action-racing genre has delivered numerous treats this generation, but not one of them has been as rewarding and relentlessly entertaining, nor as feature-packed, as this. This is Ridge Racer unbounded from the shackles of its heritage, rebuilt from the ground up into one of the most subversive, sublime street-racing games ever made.",9
"The joyous carnage of Superhot remains solid throughout Mind Control Delete, despite the fact that the road you take intentionally tries to delay and derail you. If you’ve been waiting for more of this distinct gunplay, there are at least eight hours of it here, including infinite and endless modes. VR felt like the perfect evolution of the series when it launched, but this new entry lacks an identity beyond just bringing more Superhot to the fans that crave it.",7
"The nature of the franchise itself makes Heroes VI an excellent title for gamers who don't typically spend much time in the strategy genre, and if Black Hole and Ubisoft can entice an old hand like me to stick around as well, I consider it a success.",8
"A very entertaining shooter with a strong campaign, lots of gameplay-variety and two very solid online-modes. Graphically not amazing and gameplay-wise always a little too simple, it still wins us over with a great mix of robo-drama and well delivered gags. This is the best Transformers-Game so far.",8
"Not even beautiful graphics, new animations and a great soundtrack can hide the fact that Age of Empires isn’t good enough according to modern standards. Remaster brings some nostalgic feelings but only when you get over the technical issues, lags and AI mistakes.",6
"A compelling introduction to next generation consoles, and a break from the normal formulaic anime genre, if you don’t like the game, you’re asking too much of it. Great action and good fun throughout with a multitude of missions and mini-games, Rise of a Ninja is a delight for both anime fans and casual gamers new to Naruto's great adventures.",8
"If you want to see what an exemplary roguelike looks like, look at Dead Cells. It does everything right – the controls, the level design, the combat, the character progression system, the pace – and collecting cells remains a joy even after dozens of hours. [10/2018, p.58]",9
"It can be oddly frustrating at times, yet it has enough merit to make it one of my favorite games this year. It doesn't necessarily refresh the nostalgia I had when it was SSX two releases ago, but it definitely re-introduces the fun lacking in the gaming slump I've experienced lately.",8
"It's taken multiple console generations, various rebuilds of Sonic Team and more miserably failed experiments than Eggman's R&D department, but it's finally here: a Sonic game worthy of genuine praise.",8
"While Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time’s repetitive and sometimes dull gameplay is a let-down, you’ve got to appreciate the amount of heart and detail that’s been put into it.",5
"Splatoon 3: Side Order is an excellent addition to Splatoon 3, and helps to give it a stronger identity over its predecessors. Whilst we’d like to have seen more variety in the stages and objectives, the overwhelming number of options on your weaponry and how you upgrade them makes sure that things don’t get too repetitive. We found ourselves repeatedly coming back to try just one more run which turned into five, so that should speak for itself. Splatoon fans rejoice, it’s another goodie.",8
"A cross between ""Motocross Madness"" and the ""SSX"" series... if you&#146;ve ever dreamed of doing 50 miles an hour down a shingle track or jumping an impossible 250-foot chasm on a push-bike, then this is for you.",9
"While it's clear Q Entertainment perfected the game's formula on their very first try, this iteration of the neon-lit puzzler is so charming and elegantly formed you'd be a fool to say no.",8
"River City Saga: Three Kingdoms offers solid brawler gameplay and an open world that you can get around conveniently. Combat feels impactful, and the story even has its moments. Unnecessary complexity, slippery platforming, and a tone that never quite hits make this a game primarily for the series’ faithful and big-time brawler fans who have played most of the genre’s more successful recent releases.",6
"Don't Nod latest game is like Life is Strange but with some new additions to the dialogue system. An interesting narrative adventure, although still the same formula, and the camera mechanic doesn't stand up very well through the full game.",7
"A very enjoyable action romp, which also contains plenty of accessible customisation and strategy, and has a feel about it that screams hardcore, without demanding players trade in their social life for Achievement points and a monitor-kissed, pale skin tone.",7
"There isn't much more here than we saw with Squad Assault: The West Front, when it comes right down to it. And with no facelift in the intervening years, it's going to have that much harder of a time appealing to the non-bearded types.",7
"If you want a rather great combat system with a gorgeous aesthetic then give Trek to Yomi a try, but don’t expect a game that’s going to last dozens of hours. It has a story to tell, and that story is not very long.",8
The game progressed very quickly perhaps because I felt I was constantly button bashing or the mere fact that it was a simple game to play. It's a game you can do without unless you are a diehard fan of Evil Dead.,6
"Onimusha Warlords made the jump to Switch almost entirely intact. If you loved the original and want the chance to go back to it, you won’t be disappointed. The old control scheme is still available on the D-pad, and every cutscene is kept exactly as it was before, voice acting and all. With the only changes being an excellently redone soundtrack, this port is the perfect way to relive your memories of the Playstation 2 classic. However, if you’ve never played Onimusha, this port’s only real value is as a simple way to experience a piece of history. Over the course of 18 years, other games have improved on everything that once made Onimusha great.",6
"Stuffed full of big explosions, frantic combat and wilful bombast, Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is a surprisingly enjoyable action-adventure that remains just about competent enough throughout to justify the fun it has at the expense of its own genre.",7
"The combination of simple graphics, terrific soundtrack, grotesque violence, creepy and nightmarish atmosphere, and the blistering fast and demanding gameplay makes Hotline Miami one of the best action games we've played in ages. Buy it. Buy it now.",9
"The problem really lies with the game being far too stilted and linear, shunting players from one mission to the next without giving them much choice in the matter. In drawing the game back to its rawest roots, Rockstar has done the series an injustice by taking one step back too many. [Christmas 2004, p.116]",4
"The haunting main theme (especially if it's dark and you're overtired) and gloom of rainy New York adds an appropriate layer of anxiety to the experience, which is short enough to play in a single weekend day sitting if you're really on the edge of your seat.",7
"Overall, King of Seas is a serviceable action-RPG with a pirates theme that is intended for a more casual audience. Its mechanics are solid, and the title is entertaining enough for short bursts of gameplay, but its grindy and repetitive nature quickly takes the wind out of its sails. Some of my complaints are certainly fixable in future updates, at which point I imagine the game to be a solid option for those who yearn for a decent but simplistic pirate life simulator. For now, I'd steer clear until some changes are implemented, or you can wait for a substantial sale.",7
"Ultimately, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage proves to be an uneven experience where the characters are more interesting than the plot. With a final twist that doesn't feel earned and fails to illuminate the game's greater mystery, it's hard to imagine players eagerly awaiting the second half of the story when it arrives on April 15. However, it's still possible that the remainder of the title could continue building its wonderful characters and make the juice worth the squeeze.",7
"There is no doubt that Arma III is realistic. In fact, it is the best combat simulator on the market. Is it fun though? For me, I found it an exercise in frustration at times. Games need to entertain me, not frustrate me.",7
"With incredibly satisfying gameplay, a constant stream of unlocks, and a world that challenge every cell of your being, Dead Cells is a must own for anyone who likes even one aspect of what has been mentioned here. Every success will fill you with endorphins, every failure will inspire you to get better. When you finally take out the final boss you will be elated. It is here that Dead Cells lets you know that it is just the beginning, there are a few more go around yet, and each one gets harder and harder. This is the kind of game that can last you forever, you just have to let it beat you in the head a few times.",10
"Arma 3 makes big steps forward with a huge world and more vehicles and weapons. This time around its trump card is Steam workshop integration though, making downloading mods effortless. A smart move by Bohemia Interactive because it are those mods that will give Arma 3 its long lifespan. Unfortunately Arma 3 is quite inaccessible and doesn't seem to grow along with modern game design on certain fronts. Space time and perseverance are your best friends here, until Bohemia's support starts paying off.",8
"Even though its overarching story world could be fleshed out further, Dicefolk offers a refreshing take on the roguelike formula. Thanks to its combat mechanics, dice system, and variety of chimeras and equipment, gameplay is varied and complex while still being accessible to newcomers. Added to this, the feature of customising different dice allows players to tailor their dice according to their personal tastes and playstyle, making Dicefolk a good fit for both casual and more hard-core roguelike fans.",8
"South of Midnight is one of the hits that Xbox Game Studios has been crying out for. With a simple but captivating narrative, the game presents good characters and moves you with clear and profound messages. Despite the somewhat repetitive combat, the game is fun in its simplicity and finds its brilliance in a restrained and great folkloric world, governed by beautiful songs and led by the excellent protagonist Hazel.",8
"Forza Horizon 5 is an incredible step forward for the series: with a plethora of brand new missions and challenges, and brilliant ideas to represent a colourful nation through eleven diverse biomes, Playground Games reaches new heights and shows the real face of the new generation of consoles.",9
"Emergence should serve as a great launching point for Ritual’s experiment. It’s a solid game that knows its audience, and while it is pared down, that’s only as far as needed for a game half the length and cost of an average one.",8
"Those who have already played the first one should not expect anything new in Tropico 3 - the gameplay is almost identical. This is good news for fans, because the original is still a great game, but we would rather have liked to see more innovations.",8
"Paleo Pines is a simple farming sim with a decent hook that, though not as sprawling or intense as something like Stardew Valley, is still a great way to while away a few hours and a great entry point to the genre for younger gamers that may get overwhelmed by it’s more complex cousins. Also, you can ride dinosaurs. When is that ever not fun?",7
"This is a great re-visitation to the roots of my gaming experience... Thank you for doing such a great job on this game, and the only improvement I would say is make it harder to miss jumping between vines... And that's a minor complaint, really.",8
"Although the slow tempo of the gameplay might not be appealing to everyone, and although the story could have ended much, much better, Close to the Sun is still a great title that easily worth 5 to 6 hours of your time.",8
"Despite being a little too difficult, even on the easy setting, and having all the break-neck speed of a run away yak in a snowdrift Galactic Civilizations is actually an enjoyable experience.",7
"The lovable Jobski and his part-time endeavors are absolutely worth checking out on Switch. Even if you’ve already played the mobile version of Part Time UFO, this latest release adds co-op, and the adventure and stacking modes I mentioned earlier, so there’s reason to jump back in. We all need a dose of pure happiness now and again, and if there’s anything that comes out HAL’s version of the classic claw machine, it’s joy.",8
"Card games can be a tough sell, especially in video games. The threat of mechanical complexity can put some off, while for others it just seems a boring choice when fully-animated adventures are just as readily available. Sometimes, Foretales doesn’t do the best job of countering this argument, as it can disappear up itself through endless, monotonous combat. And yet, when it puts down the dagger and lets you explore the world to work things out for yourself, it shows that we’re nowhere near close running out of engaging new ways to use small slabs of art.",7
"The addition of loot – a dizzying array of weapons and armor with different damage, arcane, elemental, and bonus attributes – adds even more variety to an already deep and satisfying combat system.",9
"I didn't feel as connected to Alan's world or story, which were the main draws for me in the first game, but the gameplay is streamlined and improved in this sequel. American Nightmare is not quite as gripping of an experience, but I certainly got my mystery-laden, flashlight-burning fun out of it.",8
"While it is certainly one of the most accessible RTS games I've ever played, Age of Empires: Definitive Edition does feel too outdated for newcomers. Unintelligent AI, monotony, and unbalanced gameplay hold it back from competing with modern strategy games out right now.",6
"Leaning more towards the action side of its gameplay, and offering an Arcade mode to take full advantage of refined mechanics, this Alan Wake spin-off could be seen as forgetting its glorious predecessor, but that would be a mistaken judgement. The story is clearly well-linked to the original, and the atmosphere, helped by a new setting and this spot-on atmosphere and writing combination, deliver a true Alan Wake experience. If you're a fan, this full-fledged XBLA game is unmissable.",8
"Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is a competent and well-done remaster of the first three Monkey Ball console games. There are issues with how engaging those games can be, mostly due to the nature of the franchise's arcade style, so there are caveats about replayability. That said, Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania makes up for that repetitiveness by including as many modes and as much variety as possible outside of its core gameplay loop, which gives both new and returning fans something to look forward to, especially thanks to the multiplayer party games from Super Monkey Ball Deluxe.",6
"From the very beginning, the controls will hinder gamers enough that it becomes frustratingly annoying. And while the fast-paced action sequences are welcome additions, there aren&#146;t enough to hold a gamer&#146;s interest.",6
"Obviously, we need to take the game as the piece of history it is. Probably not the game the average player is looking for these days, but if you understand what you're buying, it's definitely a great choice.",8
"Diablo 2: Resurrected Review – For the Faithful By Ed McGlone Published on September 30, 2021 Home » Reviews » Diablo 2: Resurrected Review – For the Faithful Share Tweet Night Mode Diablo 2 Resurrected on PC Diablo 2: Resurrected is a remaster simultaneously complex, and also incredibly simple. Visually, it’s a night and day difference between its predecessor, even on the Switch. But from a gameplay perspective, it is incredibly faithful, almost to a fault. Very little has been changed from the original release which will likely be music to the ears of the most hardcore Diablo 2 fans, resistant to change. In that sense, it’s a very “simple” upgrade. However, that decision not to use this opportunity to spruce things up may end up being a thorn at the side of newcomers and fans without rose-tinted glasses. Let’s talk about what Diablo 2: Resurrected gets right first. Visually Diablo 2: Resurrected is a triumph. It takes a very old game that looks, let’s face it, like ass by today’s standards, and turns it into something charming and wonderful to behold. By charming and wonderful, I of course mean gory, gothic, and dark with a new level of detail that was not possible in the original game. Fans wouldn’t have it any other way in that regard. Gameplay-wise, very little has changed because very little needed to change. Diablo 2 is still an all-time great game and that is still the case in Resurrected. All of the game’s classes are incredibly distinct from each other and each has a multitude of different play styles you can elect to spec into. There are Trap Assassins, Elementalist Assassins, Bow Amazons, Javasons, Werewolf Druids, Werebear Druids, Hammerdins, Whirlwind Barbs, Summoner Necros, and Bone Necros, Ice, Fire, and Thunder Sorceresses, I could go on and on. Layered on top of that are gear and set items that can further augment your gameplay and of course the fabled Runewords that players can chase to really perfect their builds. Leveraging all of that and creating your perfect character is definitely a grind. It’s a grind that may not make sense to an outsider, because at the end of the day you’re just running through the same content you did before, just faster, but those of us that love the genre do get it and love it for what it is. What’s great too is that players now have an easier way of getting to experience the lore, environment, and story of Diablo 2. Diablo 3 had a really compelling story that is heavily connected to the events of Diablo 2. While you can still enjoy Diablo 3 without having ever played its predecessor, it’s far more enjoyable if you do know fully what’s going on. And with Diablo 4 coming at some point in the future, it’s absolutely worth a single playthrough for the story and to experience this legendary game at least once, even if you’re not planning on staying a while or killing Baal 10,000 times. All of that said, while yes, Diablo 2 is still an excellent game, it never was a perfect game, and there are some issues that were forgivable back when it was originally released that stick out like sore thumbs now in Diablo 2: Resurrected. I have extremely fond memories of Diablo 2 going back to my days in middle school and high school. My friends and I would spend hours perfecting our magic find gear and mastering our speed runs through Mephisto and Baal to grind for better loot. The funny thing about memories, though, is that sometimes your brain selectively chooses to remember good ones, and deletes all of the bad ones. For example, I barely remembered that Stamina was even a thing, and yeah it’s very much a drag early on. While it improves over time as you pump up your Vitality, I can totally see fans that are not married to the idea of loving Diablo 2, getting frustrated very easily over it, and giving up on it before it starts to resolve itself. If the frequent battles with your Stamina in the early game don’t scare players away, the inventory management might. This is another Diablo 2 memory I subconsciously left behind apparently. I do not remember having to constantly go into my inventory to either drop stuff, or go back and forth to town to stash and sell items as often as I apparently need to while playing Diablo 2: Resurrected. Did I just never pick things up in the original game? Did I just not know anything better back then? I don’t know the answer to those questions, but the reality is that in 2021 it’s kind of brutal and not in a good way. Your choices are basically to be extremely selective on what you decide to stop and pick up and then possibly miss out on upgrades, or just spend most of your gameplay time in your inventory. While I’m fortunate that the version of Diablo 2 that contained respeccing made it into Diablo 2: Resurrected, I would have really preferred to just have unlimited respeccing as you do in Diablo 3. As it stands, it’s a pain in the ass to experiment and you’ll need to really commit to your play style and resort to starting a new character if you want to have easy access to something different. Finally, let me just also add, that the lack of a local couch co-op option for console players is a total bummer. I have to imagine, considering Diablo 3 had the option, that it probably wasn’t a philosophical choice, but rather it probably just wasn’t possible. Still, that doesn’t make it any less of a disappointment. I know that hardcore Diablo 2 fans don’t want to even entertain the idea of Diablo 3 seeping into their beloved game; I totally get that sentiment and don’t want a watered-down version of Diablo 2 either. However, a few modern touches, addressing the three biggest pain points I mentioned above would have gone a long way to properly resurrecting Diablo 2 and making it a premier ARPG in 2021. It doesn’t reach that potential, sadly, but it’s still an all-time great game that mostly holds up as long as you can look past its dated features.",8
Brothers in Arms: Double Time contains two dated World War II games that have actually fared off worse in making the transition to the Wii. This is a compilation you will want to avoid.,3
"The game is definitely worth spending time with, but I'd be hesitant to break it out at a party where people are unfamiliar with the franchise. [Issue #45 – March/April 2020, p. 21]",8
"Proves that this series can truly transcend time, with the game being just as fun as it was nearly 15 years ago, while also bringing new additions that will make it near impossible to go back to the original.",9
"I really loved battling through the various maps and tackling a pretty difficult campaign. On top of that, there are more than a few ways to replay it and one mode designed to have you checking in every day, which is something that isn’t outside of the realm of possibility given how much I liked it.",8
"A mix of detailed cut scenes and graphically pleasing levels helps move the adventure along, but cannot cover up what is essentially a derivative and straightforward action game hanging its hopes on a movie licence.",5
"We’ve learned what the rogues are after, but at the halfway point in the series, we still don’t know why. With only two episodes left, Telltale needs to raise the stakes and ramp up the urgency of Batman’s mission.",6
"This great brawler captivates you with fine graphics, excellent playability and an awesome selection of fighters. (…) That´s just the way we want our portable titles to be. Well done, Capcom!",9
"Undoubtedly set to be divisive, We Are OFK will garner fans in with its catchy pop tunes and emotional storytelling, but also lose just as many with narrative and character omissions, light gameplay and purposefully cheesy dialogue. Still, for better or worse, this is an experience not like many others. Captivating cinematography also paints a haunting if bittersweet L.A. narrative. Like a classic pop debut that its own self is based on, We Are OFK has heart and moments that’ll reel you in while remaining plenty messy. If all else, isn’t that how this road was always going to go?",6
"Some practical design choices, along with a host of inspired gameplay ideas, make this a title well worth checking out. There are a ton of missions and a local multiplayer option for when the single-player journey comes to an end.",8
Bonkies is a solid cooperative effort. Story and presentation is kept light-hearted and the building doesn't feel hectic enough to ruin friendships. Some of the stages are kept fairly straight forward but the increasing complexity of the campaign does give a crew enough to consider. It's a shame the levels roll out in such a linear fashion and I do feel the time limits are an unnecessary addition. Solo players will feel short-changed but Bonkies feels good with friends.,7
"Brings the first two games to the Xbox warts and all, with a boatload of extra content that'll take hours to unlock. Live subscribers and fighting-game fans should be sure to grab a copy, but if you didn't like DOA or DOA2 before now, this isn't going to change your mind.",8
"As a modern video game, a few things hold it back from being truly great, but as a nod to the days when developers created characters just to have more 'tude than that fat plumber, it's a lot of fun.",7
"Judgment is by no means terrible, just mediocre. It’s as if someone was reading ""Making Fighting Games for Dummies"", and literally followed the instructions step by step, without thinking about ways to make it something more. Considering the history of the series, there’s so much that could have been done, and just wasn’t.",6
"It lacks the depth required of a game that will stand the test of time and live on for months if not years to come, but for simple fun, either alone or with a few mates, SEGA has a winner on its hands.",7
"Persona 4: Dancing All Night has some big negatives against it, including a short song list and rough difficulty. But it's a ton of fun, the music is great, and the visuals are top notch. It's great for Persona fans. But, for everyone else, it's a tough sell.",8
"Endless Space 2 doesn't sugarcoat the 4x experience, and it can be daunting when you realize that all 600 icons on the screen have a tooltip you need to read to make just this one decision. Despite all that complexity, none of it seems unnecessary, which means every one of those tooltips has essential information.",9
"With fun puzzles and a funnier story in yet another of its game series, Telltale Games has shown everybody that the success and quality of its Sam & Max franchise wasn’t just a fluke, and that any developer/publisher that is interested creating episodic gaming has only to look Telltale’s way on how to do it right.",8
"Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide is a frantic, engaging, Left-4-Dead-influenced cooperative action game. It's got a solid gameplay, five unique characters and thirteen missions to keep you entertained for a long time.",8
"Loop Hero is something truly unique: you could fairly describe it as a sort of reverse tower defence roguelike deck-building strategy RPG, but that doesn’t really do it justice. It’s a game that takes all those pieces and combines them into something that isn’t quite like anything else out there. Sharp writing and a story that moves effortlessly between morbid humour and murky existentialist musing tie it all together nicely, but its in the fascinating experience of exploring the little details of its web of intertwined systems that Loop Hero finds its true brilliance.",9
"This fusion of visual novel of rhythm game isn't exactly perfect, but speaking as someone who loves Persona (and Shoji Meguro's work in particular), I really enjoyed my time with this one. It might be pure fan service, but sometimes maybe that's enough.",8
The Thaumaturge's history and gameplay mechanics combines perfectly. It seems like a mistery novel meets RPG turn's based game which its exploration rewards you with more and more quality quests and new paths to follow.,8
"It boils down to this: Either you're so hardcore into ""Mahhval, baby!"" that you simply must 'take it for a ride' everywhere you go, or you've dabbled in either prior console version of the game and want something deep with online play to give that shiny new Vita something to do. If you don't fall into either of these camps, then Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 on the Vita is probably not going to be worth your time, because you either prefer the console experience, have been worn out by the game already, or simply never cared for it to begin with.",7
"In any case, if you don’t mind the sexual nature of the motivation mini-games and are looking for a JRPG that makes for a fun play in short burst and is a little different, then taking a peek at Criminal Girls: Invite Only might offer you a fairly enjoyable, if flawed, time.",6
"It’s not quite a triumph, but Zen Pinball 2’s Portal table is a stand out in the series’ expansive table list. While there may not be enough meat here to thrill Portal fans with a passing fancy for virtual pinball, it’s definitely a solid choice for anyone who has enjoyed Zen Pinball 2’s other games.",8
"Puzzle Bobble EveryBubble! is a fun little game that can bring some serious challenge the longer you play. The extra Space Invaders mode is a super cool addition that can challenge even the biggest Puzzle Bobble pro. The super cute presentation may turn off some players, but fans of the series will feel right at home here. A nice and cheerful puzzle game that can be enjoyed by anyone of any age and a very good addition to the Puzzle Bobble franchise!",10
"Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIII only looks good on paper, with its historical setting and many things to do. In practice, however, it is just the most boring strategic game to play, afflicted with an unstable frame-rate and audio bugs.",4
"One of those games that tried to step in the follow in the footsteps of innovative god games like ""Black & White"" or the classic ""Populous,"" but is woefully cursed with poorly executed gameplay.",4
"A nice turn-based strategy with RPG elements, what scores particularly with the medieval territory and administration of your army. Thanks to this you will forgive it the technical issues and some design mistakes. [Issue#255]",6
"If this is Hironobu Sakaguchis last story, it's certainly sad, since it feels like he's finally managed to get back into form. It's a lavish, emotional tale told in a high pace, with strong, unusual characters, moral ambiguity and delivered with the precision we expect from the man. The one major complaint? It should have arrived earlier, while the Wii still had some life in it. Now it risks sinking into obscurity due to the target platform collecting dust in wardrobes.",9
"Reality Fighters has its fun moments, and showing off the AR fighting to a technophobe can be enjoyable, but you will tire of the game incredibly quickly after you realize just how simple the fighting mechanics are, and how little depth the game has.",4
"It is nowhere near Minecraft, but nonetheless it is a decent sandbox game, and on Wii U, it is the best. Cube Life: Island Survival comes at a low price and with the promise to be constantly updated, so why not to try it?",7
"The one concern I would raise is game length. If you aren’t that much of a completionist, you can “complete” the game in an afternoon however the game compensates with so much extra content of repeating levels again and other secrets.",7
"The truly sad part is that Lock's Quest is just a few design tweaks away from being a fantastic game. All the ingredients are here, but the overzealous chefs at 5th Cell screwed up the recipe.",7
"Diablo 2 Resurrected is a beautiful journey down memory lane. It's a game that brings out memories and joy and, sometimes, rage (it can be brutally unforgiving). This new-old Diablo 2 took us home for a while. A sweet illusion, but its longevity depends on the work the developers still have to do.",8
"As a combination of both political strategy and Lovecraftian drama, The Shrouded Isle takes this idea and provides a comfortably tense experience whereby every choice should matter but with enough leeway that inexperienced players can still make mistakes. Fans of classic horror literature may be drawn to this game through its distortedly gothic art style and otherworldly premise, but the large difficulty curve may be too complicated for them, even if the repetitive gameplay structure can feel rewarding once you get the hang of it.",8
"The game can be completed in approximately six to eight hours, depending on how quickly you master the combat and if you choose to watch the cutscenes. It may not sound like a lot but after giving your thumbs a serious work out, it’s actually just the right amount of time needed to tell Raiden’s story.",9
"From the boxers’ entrances to the lowered house lights, Vivid Games has done a great job of making Real Boxing feel as authentic as possible. Fans of the sport and simulated fighting aficionados alike will get a lot out of this offering, and with a multiplayer mode bringing even more to the ring, this is a knockout port.",8
"Yes, it is short. And it takes the by now well-known Telltale stencil and imposes it on our most favorite building block game. But the result is what the once announced “Adventure mode” in Minecraft promised: a big fantasy adventure with humor, suspense and real heroes.",8
"Even though annually released games don't often have a lot of room for improvement, Just Dance 2014 adds new ingredients to its formula and is as much fun as always. If you like to play with your friends and even go online for a little dance challenge, this game will suit you well.",8
"The Season mode is as basic as it gets, and there isn't much besides that. The riding mechanics are fantastic, however, and that's what makes the game a nice pickup for motorcycle racing fans.",7
"I had a good time with Part Time UFO for what it was: a quick puzzle game and a good way to kill a few minutes. It's not going to monopolize anybody's time, but the game is competently put together, has a fun premise, and fits great on the Switch. There aren't a lot of failings here outside of the difficulty spike and its simplistic visuals that make it feel closer to a 3DS game. It's just good, clean fun.",7
"Drakensang: The Dark Eye is a rare breed these days. It's not a hardcore RPG, but it still offers a lot of complexity. The beauty of the game is the way in which the developers tailored the gameplay to include newbies without dumbing-down the genre. Don't miss a chance to play a game marinated in the classic RPG tradition.",7
"Criminal Girls: Invite Only is a niche title at best, and it'll appear strange to any outsiders looking in. Despite that, the content isn't overly offensive in context, and it's handled about as well as you could expect.",4
"It's a two-faced game that seems to be too complicated, old fashioned and unfair to new players. But it has a fascinating part when well-organized gamers play co-op and multiplayer matches.",7
"Revengeance can be summed up in one word: ""fun."" Well, maybe two words are better: ""stupid fun."" As was shown with DmC, there are still a lot of fans out there who want to have button-mashing fun and be rewarded with carnage in its most primal form.",8
"The game has taken an interesting departure from its predecessor and I found myself slightly preferring the first game. That’s probably just down to my own personal preference in genres so if a deck-building / action-RPG / Rogue-like hybrid appeals to you, Forced Showdown is worth your time and money.",7
"Pikuniku is a seemingly simple game packed full of clever ideas and smart design. It does a lot with very little, and makes for a delightful puzzle-platformer in doing so. It's single-player mode can feel a bit meandering and frustrating at times as you struggle to make any meaningful progress, and its co-op is brilliant but just a little too short. But despite all this, it's a game that platformer fans simply must play. It's sheer brilliance wrapped in a silly, cute package, and it's by far one of the smartest platformers on Switch to date.",8
"Falling somewhere between a traditional Ridge Racer title and a Burnout game, Unbounded fails to fully succeed at recreating either experience, ending up in between the two racing franchises in terms of quality.",7
"GRIP: Combat Racing is a solid enough throwback to warrant a play from Rollcage fans but for those racing game players looking for something new, the game doesn’t deliver. It isn’t bad by any measure, but it doesn’t do enough to set pulses racing.",5
"Splatoon 2 has a lot of substance, and every bit of it is literally oozing with style. Keeping everything that made the original game great while expanding on modes, fashion, weapons and features, this is a powerfully addictive family-friendly shooter.",9
Just about the only thing that makes this a somewhat interesting title is the Create Track mode that allows you go get as creative as you want ... and it&#146;s easy to use as well.,6
"Developer Telltale has built a sterling reputation on making smart, creative episodic games based on existing intellectual properties (see exhibit ""Sam & Max), and Homestar Ruiner is no exception. [Nov 2008, p.75]",8
"But there's hardly anything new here. The plot is paper-thin, and lacks a driving sense of humor or drama to keep you interested. The game-play is just as basic as it's ever been, and frankly, if you've played any of its predecessors, you've slashed and spellcast just this way a million times before.",5
"The presentation of the game is lacking. The psychedelic backgrounds are interesting to look at in 3D, but there is only one per mode. The music is also extremely limited, which means turning down the volume is your best course of action.",6
"Monster Energy Supercross 25 represents a step forward from previous titles. The progress due to the adoption of UE5 is evident and has brought the series even closer to a true simulation. Some adjustments are still necessary to better balance the difficulty level, correct sporadic problems with the opponent AI, and improve the navigability of the UI.",8
"With its ancient China setting, Immortals Fenyx Rising: Myths of the Eastern Realm could have expanded the main game's experience in a lot of meaningful ways, but Ubisoft Chengdu preferred to play it safe, presenting an expansion that expands very little. Lacking the good writing and the hilarious characters of the main campaign, not to mention any major gameplay change, this DLC expansion is a worthwhile purchase only for those who haven't had enough of the puzzle-solving seen in Fenyx's adventure. Everyone else will find this adventure in the Eastern Realm a little stale.",6
"Neon White perfectly captures the sense of speed without compromising on accuracy or enjoyment. It’s a ride that’s worth playing, whether to appreciate its finely tuned level design, its enjoyable narrative or that sense of accomplishment when you best a run on the first try.",9
"Commandos 2 HD Remaster is a good nostalgic operation that gives a masterpiece a new coat of paint, but still retains the horrible interface that we used to forgive back in the days.",7
"Revolution has little to do with Valkyria Chronicles, as it is not a turn-based strategy, but an action-RPG, so closest point of reference would be Final Fantasy XV. Compared to it, some things in Revolution are better – like being able to control any of the four characters, – and some are way worse, like overly-simplistic gameplay and graphics that make Dynasty Warriors series come to mind. [Issue#222, p.58]",6
"There's plenty of extra goodies to keep you busy if you like to eke out every scrap of play-time for your money, but multiplayer is a fairly token addition that is underwhelming and under-populated as a result.",8
"What Nintendo Labo achieves is, at its core, exactly what Wii Sports achieved for the Wii in 2006. It encourages non-video gamers the chance to get involved with something their children love. It brings family to the fore, allows for natural teamwork to evolve and both nurtures and inspires creativity. And quite frankly, that’s hard to put a price on.",8
"Dream Drop Distance is a fine HD remaster, and the game is solid, if not the best of the series. 0.2 Birth By Sleep, on the other hand, should not be missed, and has got me incredibly excited for where the series is going to go next.",7
"Sine Mora EX represents the perfect chance to finally play the title for people who haven't yet done so, thanks to some new features, a good graphics optimization and the co-op story mode.",8
"Hunt the Night is a challenging but rewarding game that rewards players with new gear, timing, and skill. It takes place in a world where humans and monsters live in a cycle, where humans come together to stop the cycle. Dialogue in the game is intentionally vague and just enough to set the tone of the world. The story and gameplay of Hunt the Night are well-done, with a mix of melee and ranged combat with dodging.",9
"Clash: Artifacts of Chaos offers a beautiful new rendition of Zenozoik with suitable fisticuffs against whacky creatures, offset by awfully circuitous traversal and repetitive gameplay.",7
"The rides are also animated very well, but the best of the graphical action has to be reserved for the ‘Coaster Cam’, being able to view all the new water rides in the park in first person just adds that little bit more to an already decent experience.",8
"Revita isn’t doing a whole lot that we haven’t seen bits of in other games before, if not necessarily in this exact combination. But it’s doing all of it rather well, with reliable controls, challenging and fun boss encounters, enough randomness to add spice but not so much to make it all a crapshoot, and interesting choices to make with your character’s growth during each run. Those looking for their next roguelite action game to conquer will want to give this one some consideration.",8
"A new twist fora type of game that couldn't be more classic. The inclusion of puzzle elements gives this shmup a new point of view over it’s competitors. Iro Hero tells you a story and makes you fly through it switching colors and avoiding enemies, making you think and act with speed and precision if you want to succeed.",8
"""Warcraft III"" is very innovative and has production values higher than just about any game ever released on the PC, while Age of Mythology is simply a worthy successor to an excellent series.",8
"The Game Bakers, the developer of Squids Odyssey, has created a game that largely misses everything that makes the RPG genre great. As such, it quickly becomes tedious, and while I do think it would work as a free iOS game as a time waster, it doesn't work as a sit down experience on a home console.",3
"Since you're essentially buying the same game Capcom has already released twice, owners of the PS3 version won't miss anything essential skipping this. While this is in fact a great handheld fighting game, the touch features throw away any challenge and any skill needed to conquer the stages.",7
"It is true that there are works capable of going far beyond what has been done by The Silver Case and The 25th Ward, but it is also true that it is extremely difficult to find two works held together by such a valid internal coherence and, above all, a level of character writing so high.",8
"The on-screen action is a little too bewildering at times and the song offerings aren't nearly as plentiful as other DDR games. However, for its primary audience, Disney Channel Remix serves its purpose, with lots of arrow stepping and various modes to choose from.",7
"Need for Speed Unbound is not trying to be an ultrarealistic simulator or even a super comprehensive open-world online racing game experience. It wants to be a stylish, tough, and rewarding ode to street racing culture. While it’s not the best in its genre due to some weak writing and eventual repetition, Need for Speed Unbound is a surprisingly entertaining racer in a year that hasn’t seen much racing game excitement since Gran Turismo 7.",7
"There's no denying that Sudoku Gridmaster is a somewhat boring release, but its very clear in what it is and what it is attempting to accomplish, and I feel it accomplishes it quite well. I think it's a better Sudoku experience than what's included in ""Brain Age"", but that probably only really matters to those that are really into the puzzle.",6
"Enchanted Arms could best be described as a Japanese-style RPG for Dummies: it introduces players to the sort of Eastern RPG philosophies that games like Oblivion tend to shy away from: soap-operatic stories, linear narratives, turn-based combat, and lots and lots of collecting things.",8
"King of Seas does lots of things well, from its visual presentation to the simplicity of its sailing mechanics. It touches base with many of the things that made classics out of the games that came prior while streamlining the experience into something that feels like a store-brand version of the thing I actually wanted.",6
"New Super Mario Bros. brings all of the classic fun from past Super Mario Bros. releases together in one amazing greatest hits-style gameplay experience and does so in a way that only Nintendo themselves can do. If you only buy one game for your Wii console for the rest of your life, make sure it's this one.",10
"Nebuchadnezzar tries to capture the feel of the iconic city builders of the 90's like Pharaoh. While it offers an interesting Mesopotamian setting and some new mechanics regarding space and supply management, it does not provide meaningful challenge and a production level that would make it as iconic. Hopefully, it will be enriched with content from the community in the future as it currently is pretty barebones.",8
"The Expanse: A Telltale Series Episode 1 is a strong start for the series and this iteration of Telltale Games. Fans of the show will enjoy getting to learn more about Drummer’s backstory, and Cara Gee delivers a strong performance that meets expectations. The following episodes will determine if the story is able to pay off on its promising start, but the production quality and polish are clearly an improvement from Telltale’s past titles.",8
"The Sexy Brutale is a stellar mind bender, one of the best mystery themed, puzzle titles in years. Behind a seemingly simple formula lies a challenging and clever game, one wrapped in beautiful graphics and a fantastic soundtrack.",10
"The easy learning curve, the variety of characters, the sprawling levels, and the lovely sound and art all combine to make an extremely appealing and replayable game. It may only be April, but Monaco is already a strong contender for Game of the Year.",10
"Gone is the great adventure, lost to the simple need to collect stuff, and in its place is the carrot and the stick - which even the most dedicated mule will only chase so far. [May 2004, p.88]",6
"By correcting the glaring issues with the classic, Atari has delivered the kind of product gamers have wanted from them all along. The quality of Warlords fuels excitement for the other damaged gems they could find and polish in their vault.",7
Ikachan is a wonderfully crafted game and a fitting homage to the NES era of gaming and to Metroid-esque game design. The art and sound design are wonderful. The gameplay is responsive and fun. The only question is whether one hour of gameplay is enough to justify the asking price. For many the answer will be yes.,7
"Almost like an alternate universe cosplay, Ghost Song is a game that aims to appeal to your nostalgia for the old school Metroid series, while mixing in some additions from recent iterations of the genre they spawned. A few minor missteps don’t detract from an otherwise sensational package, which has a giant, charming and weirdly adorable heart.",8
"Platform magic on the highest level for the Wii. While the game offers almost everything you could ask for, it falls just a little short of perfect for a few small reasons. The main reason being that's it a tiny bit short in playtime, and the second being that while Wiimote-controls work great, you can't help but wonder if it wouldn't have worked just as good with a normal control. But considering how much gaming joy the game offers, there's no point in getting stuck on those details. This will probably be a given game on any Nintendo Wii-owners wishlist this Christmas.",9
"The real kicker to this title, however, is its cliffhanger ending (after all, this is only Episode 1 of what I presume will be at least a three- or four-part series) which is more frustrating than tantalising.",6
"The graphics will not sate the eye-candy hungry PS2 player, the plot is not particularly compelling and with the frequency of the load times and frequent (and repetitive) random battles, progress may be considered by some to be unforgivably tedious and slow.",6
"With nostalgia at its heart and enough vibrancy and style to ignite London’s nightlife, Sorry We’re Closed is very much its own beast. It's only held back by some ever so slightly clunky combat.",8
"Its beautiful scenery and personable characters will definitely grab the player. However, its immediate lack of challenge and extremely short amount of playtime are definitely hurtful to the overall quality of the game.",6
"It's a small improvement over the last Settlers, and therefore a game that many devotees will be rooting for, but there's no getting away from the fact that judged against its peers, or even its own ancestors, this is an average offering in terms of depth, challenge and longevity, and blighted by fussy technical snags to boot.",5
"Valkyria Revolution is nowhere near as good as Valkyria Chronicles and luckily it may be just a short detour into a hybrid musou/action territory. Story is kind of OK but plagued by overstaying cutscenes and loading screens, while everything else is shallow and very low budget.",6
"What could have been a beautiful marriage between Kojima Productions and Platinum Games ends up disappointing in some respects, but Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance still manages to impress and overwhelm from a sheer technical and gameplay perspective. Raiden finally gets his revenge and manages to stand on his own as a solid character.",8
"By neglecting to address the fundamental problems of the original and slicing out the online play, Monster Hunter Freedom negates the few improvements it makes to its PlayStation 2 predecessor.",6
When you get bored with the story mode and other bonus modes the single player serves up you’ll always be left with the brilliant track editor and uploaded tracks from the community – and that is GripShift’s strongest pull.,8
"I really wanted to like Forced Showdown. Maybe there’s something about it that just didn’t *click* with me. Too many half-baked ideas does not a casserole make, my mother always said. If they had taken the time to expand on what makes each of the genres compelling, this could have been a whole different review. Instead, it’s a hot mess on your keyboard.",5
"Such a deceiving title – the presentation leads you to believe you’re going to be getting a near AAA experience, which only sets up a big crash when you realize the game doesn’t live up that promise. Don’t get sucked into thinking War Times is a groundbreaking game, and you’ll get plenty of enjoyment out of it.",6
"Hard West 2 offers a fun mix of text adventures and turn-based strategy battles, with just enough of each to keep things fresh. Awesome and unique mechanics are highlighted in a combat system that forces players outside of their ""overwatch"" comfort zones, allowing new tactics not seen before in games of this ilk. A bit of fiddly control work does little to tarnish the stellar gameplay. Highly recommended for fans of the genre.",9
"Bound in Blood has a lot to offer. Great, fun gameplay mixed with likeable characters, an unpredictable plot-twisting storyline and jaw dropping visuals makes up for a high-quality title.",9
If you don’t have much experience with this genre then this is a great place to start. I loved almost every aspect of the game and if I had the time I’d probably play for the platinum trophy. I highly recommend this one and can happily endorse the price.,8
"Calling is a good alternative to survival horror highlights like Silent Hill: Shattered Memories . The atmosphere reminds us of The Ring, but the fighting is a bit awkward and involuntarily funny sometimes.",8
"Sure, the story is nothing impressive. There are moments when the generated levels do not make too much sense. Progress sometimes hinges on the placement of one health chest or one group of enemies. But, despite the randomness, Jupiter Hell feels fair and there’s a lot of depth to discover in this surprising mix.",8
"The story is bland, but on the contrary, the writing is intelligent, well-localized and entertaining more often than not. The gameplay doesn't stray very far from the norm, but the content does.",8
"RPG Maker Fes is quite an achievement; it’s a powerful, relatively easy to use set of tools that can turn your story ideas into full blown games, playable by anyone with a 3DS and an internet connection.",8
"It’s difficult to play a game like this in isolation. Sooner or later, the mind wanders back to the present – the truth is, the genre has come on in leaps and bounds since Age of Empires came on the scene all those years ago and this is one remaster that feels like it doesn’t really belong.",6
"It's certainly one of the easiest ""hardcore"" games to get into, but there's a lasting challenge to the design that'll keep you coming back for more, regardless of how many times you fail out at a level.",9
"It seems that Konami knows that the novelty of the gameplay has worn off and made a number of attempts to freshen things up a tad. Unfortunately, those attempts severely fall flat and what you're left with is a game you've seen a dozen times over, just with a new soundtrack.",8
"Whether it's by yourself or together at a party, Starwhal will leave you frustrated beyond belief in a way that will simply just make you laugh. Although the hard challenges were a little too hard and over the top even for a hard setting, overall Starwhal hits it on the head and is definitely a game you should play.",8
"Urban Trial Playground is a simple, yet enjoyable stunt show through various parts of California. The levels are well made and the scenery looks amazing. There's a good variety of levels, but they don't take that long to complete.",8
"It's as if the level designers didn't play the game, or at least not enough to realize that the game's mushy response to your button presses doesn't support the level of difficulty at which the jumping and fighting challenges are set. [Dec. 2006, p.113]",6
"The all-new sandbox environment is a welcome addition, and it matches perfectly with the classic gameplay of the LEGO series: aside from some little missteps, LEGO City Undercover is a game everyone can have fun with.",8
"PAC-MAN WORLD Re-PAC marks the pleasant and successful return of the title dated 1999, which will entertain both new and old fans. A pleasant and solid remake of a little classic, whose structure should look too simple if compared to modern games, but that’s always fun is played today.",7
"BOXBOY! will surely find an audience among those who are deeply in love with the Game Boy's sensibilities, but this writer is finding it increasingly difficult to be nostalgic for a style that never goes away. What's left, then, is a polished puzzler with surprisingly dull tendencies.",6
"Ghost Song is filled with genuine human beings who fight fiercely for each other’s happiness, and it’s a tonal balance I almost always find lovely. It’s just a shame that it doesn’t seem to realize that decent action alone would have been a sufficient accompaniment to it. Regardless of the superfluous RPG trappings, Ghost Song offers beautiful sights to be found within its mysterious halls.",6
"Gamers who have been versed in the worlds of Sly Cooper, Jak and Daxter, etc. will find the new Pitfall entry with little to offer. It sports solid, loosely Pitfall-inspired gameplay, there is just nothing new about it.",6
"Arma is a great series with a very specific public and we love it for it, but this entry would be better with a bit of evolution and lacks some important features. It is still a unique experience well worth your time if you want a very different FPS.",8
"Diablo 2: Resurrected is a game that goes far beyond the nostalgia of the fans. A solid title that reminds us of what Blizzard has meant to video games and makes us understand why we need it to come back someday. Whether or not you enjoyed it twenty years ago, it is truly a must-have.",9
"If a quick and dirty deathmatch is something that appeals to you, go for it, but be warned. Soldier of Fortune: Payback is very shallow and at best is a budget game, and there are far more compelling shooters out there.",4
"Good news for the Hack and Slash lovers. X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a fantastic brawler. On the graphic and audio side the videogame does nice work, but it's in the gameplay area where the new Raven effort shines above those hundreds of forgettable movie adaptations.",8
"Its quality is not on par with the excellent campaigns, due to balancing issues and the absence of any kind of online mode, but Shovel Knight Showdon is still a very fun party game for up to four players.",8
"A great sports title and really succeeds because it provides a deep and rewarding experience for serious sports gamers, but it also provides a fun and casual experience for those who just have basic knowledge of the sport and want to have some fun playing baseball.",9
"Loop Hero is a brilliant piece of work that plays and succeeds with the idea of repeating gameplay loops via gameplay, story and even meta angles. It’s an absolute beast that will easily rip players to shreds, but thanks to simple gameplay that makes great use of deck-building, automatic battles and experimentation, it ensures that everyone will have a blast trying to design the best world possible for each run. Throw in a gorgeous presentation that perfectly channels classic early-era RPGs and you easily have what could wind up being one of the year’s best games. A fresh twist on roguelikes, it truly is a loop that you’ll gladly want to explore again and again and again and again…",9
"It’s a game that will have you striving to get through the levels to unlock more hacks and cores, but the endless mode is where it really lets you go to town on everything you’ve unlocked. If you were a fan of the original, you’ll be right at home in Superhot: Mind Control Delete.",8
"The execution may be flawed in a few ways, but the game’s adorable charm and earnest attempts to keep things fresh are just enough to make it a better game than its successor in nearly every way.",8
"Unless you're trying to play or collect all of the NEOGEO releases coming to Switch, it's hard for me to recommend Biomotor Unitron. Games that came before it, like Quintet's Robotrek, have taken a similar premise and created a much more well rounded experience. Biomotor is simply mired in repetitive gameplay that just isn't paid off by any enjoyable story or character moments. While it isn't broken or unplayable, it's mediocre and frustrating in equal measure. Best to steer clear from these outdated robot wars or at least wait for a steep discount.",5
"Despite its reliance on clichés the game starts off well, with a great atmosphere and some sublime visuals (water effects and sunsets are particularly nice) but once you delve a little deeper the limitations of the hugely linear missions and combat really drag you down and suck most of the enjoyment out of the game.",4
High Moon Studios has successfully rebounded with a Transformers game that delivers on so many levels. The varied and entertaining single player campaign coupled with the deep multiplayer experience makes Fall of Cybertron a must own for any Transformer fan or even someone who just wants to have some mindless Transformer fun.,9
"Namco Museum does a great job of highlighting the illustrious lineage of one of video gaming's most famous arcade companies; not only is it packed with addictive games that will keep you glued to your Switch for many weeks to come, but it boasts excellent emulation, a host of options, online leaderboards, a special challenge mode for each game and a new version of Pac-Man VS. which is sure to become the go-to party title for many Switch players. While there are a couple of titles that we'd have swapped out for other, more worthy offerings from Namco's past, you're still getting an excellent selection of games for a reasonable price here.",8
"With top-notch graphics and sound that believably invoke the Metroid series, not to mention some really cool pinball innovations that incorporate many trademark features of the series, this game really does feel like a seamless, if unlikely, merging between classic arcade pinball and the creepy-cool Metroid Prime series.",8
"The Big Con is a nice game, but not very deep. It entertains for the time it lasts, but in the end it doesn't give much in terms of experience, if not for its graphic style that stands out on everything else.",6
"Neon White nails the “one more try” mentality. With complex and fast levels, great enemy variety, and easy readability, it feels like a fantastic intro to speedrunning. My biggest gripe? I want more! Not that there isn’t enough, but I just can’t get enough of the Neons and the gripping nature of this game.",10
"The Last Story bravely asks those who believe the JRPG genre has nothing left to offer to take another look. Beneath its surface, it bears little resemblance to its peers. At the same time, it's in good company as another entry on one of the most intimidating resumes in the video game business.",8
"Where Silent Storm shines is in combat -- not so much from the combat engine itself, which is nice enough but which uses roughly the same mechanics (with action points and familiar modes of fire) as other tactical games, but in watching and taking part in the combat.",9
"Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth is a massive leap forward when compared to the first entry of the Final Fantasy VII Remake. It is way more ambitious, with an open world that is as detailed as alive, and that is very gratifying to explore. Even if not all of the secondary activities are especially memorable, it is undeniable that Square Enix's endeavors to turn this into a more diversified and fresh experience can be felt right from the get-go.",10
While it may sound like there's plenty of replay value here with the ability to play through it as two entirely different characters it's really just the same strategy game with the concept totally reversed.,5
"A decent, if forgettable, RPG romp through familiar lands, with familiar faces, for familiar goals. Its surprisingly thoughtful and intelligent battle system mostly makes up for its weak character customization, lackluster graphics and overly linear world.",6
"Despite the demo being met with scepticism, Square Enix has crafted a truly fantastic game that is a stunning change of pace and feel for the Final Fantasy series, but still manages to stay largely true to its roots. Beautiful. [JPN Import; Issue #139, p.60]",9
"Banana Mania takes the best Super Monkey Ball games and combines them into one solid package. Frustrations from those original games remain, and the lack of online play is a disappointment, but new options allow for a less stressful time.",7
"The scale of one’s enjoyment with a game like B.I.O.T.A. depends entirely on what kind of game you’re expecting and more importantly, what area of game you end up gravitating towards coming out of it. For those in the Metroidvania camp, the game is an inoffensive if not entirely unique interpretation on the template. But on the platforming side, fortunes are far more favorable, playing host to sequences that are both well-executed and challenging on top. The fact these bright spots are so tucked away, though — caught between needless back-tracking and a general world design that can feel too linear — can lend itself to B.I.O.T.A. feeling too uneven and demanding on one’s patience to warrant seeing it through. Even so, it’s these precision platforming sequences, working together with the hyper-retro leanings, that just about pulls it from out the doldrums. It might not be posing any original ideas, but for better or worse, B.I.O.T.A.‘s know-how on old-school traits just about keeps it afloat.",6
"Lushfoil Photography Sim is worth playing, especially for those who want to dabble in digital photography. The techniques used in the game mimic those in real life, the maps are close to accurate, and the added little challenges test your creative eye. The game is like visiting someone’s memory as you’re bound to a specific area, but the maps are huge and very detailed. While it does feel weird and somewhat scary being the only person wandering around popular tourist spots, exploring the wildlife and these unique places all by yourself turns them into a delightful nature/travel photography playground.",8
"For those gamers that were fans of the original from a single player aspect, Rise of the Witch King doesn't really add that much more such it should grab your attention. For die-hard Lord of the Rings fans, the minimal content additions will likely be enough.",7
"Neon White, behind the sexy suitors and anime villains, underneath the storyline and relationship building, is a game about speedrunning. It’s about learning and replaying, and it’s about beating your friends. It’s a modern iteration of a classic, simple premise, but without perfect execution, a simple premise can easily flop. Thankfully, Neon White delivers nearly flawlessly. Just make sure to take your time with this whirlwind ride, you’ll thank me for it.",9
"If we add a repetitive level design, a problematic gameplay and some poor technical elements, the result is... the typical movie adaptation. And unfortunately, Iron Man stays painfully true to this rule. [June 2008]",4
"Wuppo is a platform game with its own distinct look and feel. The story that is told throughout the game is fun, and so is the interaction with the world. There are some minors annoyances while playing, but those do not spoil the fun to be had in Wuppo.",8
"A lot of creativity is embedded here beneath the surface. However, the absence of a story delivered in a compelling way, along with several other questionable design decisions, hinders your motivation to make it all the way through.",6
"For a few bucks less, Ninja Theory should just have ditched this lackluster mini-campaign and instead have thrown Vergil into Dante's adventure and the Bloody Palace as a playable character. As it stands, I can only really recommend Vergil's Downfall to people who desperately want to burn a couple of hours time and /or types who revel into mastering a new character. So yeah, you should probably give this a miss, as long as Capcom doesn't make Vergil an option for the main story.",4
"Achieves a stunning degree of realism, both in graphics and actual game physics. If you enjoy racing your friends or merely the computer in a realistic environment, Forza Motorsport was designed for you.",9
"A refreshingly simple 3D tower defense game. It blends the strategy of building and upgrading your units with action-packed third-person shooting, and the result is unadulterated mayhem with a lot of visual charm.",8
"My only complaint with Splatoon 3: Expansion Pass Wave 2 – Side Order is that it could’ve used a bit more variety for a mode that requires you to replay it so much to get the most out of it. While it may not hit the set-piece highs as past game expansions, this is exactly what I want to see from Splatoon as a series, and I hope it is included in the next game as an optional mode. The team nailed everything here, and if it ever does get more added through free updates, it will be perfect.",9
"If your a fan of Fatal Frame and Japanese Horror in general, you will probably like Calling. It succeeds in being scary without the shock and gore factor, but don't expect stellar gameplay.",6
"Much like that final mission enemy, Hard West 2 gets it right where it counts. Despite some thin RPG trappings, it's ultimately a highly-accomplished game of tactical combat with two or three genuinely terrific ideas executed exceptionally well. While it does suffer from a lack of imagination in some of its map design, that doesn't detract too much from how enjoyable it is to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with your posse and find creative ways to put down hordes of Wild West demons.",8
"This is the Police 2 is presented well, featuring a great visual style, accompanied by an equally great score, but a poorly penned script, coupled with gameplay that is not engaging, keeps it from realising its full potential.",5
"Space Invaders Extreme took basic game play into an enjoyable online extravaganza; Arkanoid Live hasn’t really evolved Arkanoid at all. In fact, apart from the little polish on the menu and a multiplayer option, the game is pretty much the same as I played 15 years ago!",5
"Samorost 3 is a beautiful game and definitely worth experiencing if only for the visuals and musicality. It is a pleasant adventure with some great ideas, but is let down by its short gameplay and sometimes frustrating puzzles.",6
"Slick, detailed visuals are marred by inane camera work, and while the creature, explosion, and limb-whacking sound effects are all boffo, developer High Voltage should have jettisoned the dance beats and synthetic guitar strains for something more along the lines of Slayer.",7
"Sonic Rivals pulls it together pretty well, but the game feels more like a mini-game than a fully fleshed out product. Overall, Sonic Rivals is unfortunately too short, and the concept is too simple, to hold the interest of most gamers for very long.",5
Anyone who has played these Monkey Ball titles before will be satisfied with this new available version. Those who have never touched the series before and are looking for a challenging physics-based platforming adventure should try out Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania.,8
"If you've played another Lips game, then you know exactly what you are getting here: a regular singing mode, the freestyle mode, and the MyLips social tool. There's nothing new in this title, which is disheartening considering this is the third iteration of the franchise.",6
"All at once. Astro boy is challenging, beautiful and in these days, utterly unique in its simplicity. Action fans will want to snap this up at the very first opportunity. [JPN Import]",8
"Without spoiling any of the story elements, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage is captivating so far with the first act. The characters are well-written, the narrative, albeit slow, is gripping, and the game is gorgeous to look at as you take videos of the wildlife and characters around you. It'll be exciting to see where the narrative goes when the second part releases this April. Let's just hope those frame rate hiccups and performance issues get fixed by then.",8
"As a Rhythm RPG, the team at Puuba wanted to keep the strategic elements of a good role playing game but to also speed it up. The Metronomicon offers fun characters, a solid and wacky story line, strategic elements and some really great tunes. And with the colorful and fun character design, this is a game that should be dancing into everyone’s homes.",8
"Wilson’s Heart gets a lot of things right. The spooky atmosphere, charming camp, and long-form narrative are great proofs of concept for virtual reality adventures. Considering most VR titles available right now feel more like glorified tech demos than full-fledged games, I enjoyed the extended sessions of this six-to-eight-hour experience. But Wilson’s Heart’s limited interactivity, lack of freedom, and wooden combat show developers still have a lot to learn about creating truly immersive virtual reality experiences.",7
"Dark Sector doesn’t try to revolutionize the action game genre. It just wants you to have fun, by killing enemies with an awesome weapon and going online to do the same. And it certainly succeeds as being a fun game, with great presentation values.",8
Plays like a dream! It feels like the controller melds with your hands and you become one with it! The game is really that smooth for two main reasons: Jak responds to the slightest touch of a button and the frame rate is at a steady 60 fps and never drops.,10
"Splatoon 2 is arguably the best entry in a multiplayer game from Nintendo. The game does everything better than the original Splatoon, although at first glance it could seem the same. Salmon Run and Hero Mode are just honey in the overall; it is excellent in its conception.",8
"what is currently available feels like a prototype for something better. If the campaign were just longer, tighter, more refined, then Hellbound would be an easy recommendation. Saibot created something that feels solid in the hands but doesn't quite stick the landing. You can only play the campaign so many times before you've seen it all and Hellbound simply doesn't deliver much else.",4
"As a whole, Minis on the Move feels like a bit like a bait and switch, ensnaring gamers familiar with the franchise's established gameplay, only to deliver something unexpected and not entirely satisfying.",5
"Though this fun piece of software does what it needs to do, the limitations of the 3DS’s abilities, the lack of direction and the painstaking work that is required makes RPG Maker Fes feel like a let-down.",5
"Unbound is everything a fan of the franchise could want and an example of how to revamp a series without losing any of the essence of what a good Need for Speed is. More than just an excellent arcade racing game, Criterion leaves players with shining eyes as they imagine how much better this could be in the future.",10
"Castlevania fanatics will hate the unnecessary liberties taken with their favorite characters, fighting game enthusiasts will abhor the crippling lack of character balance, and everyone should just cross their fingers that the next game to bear this franchise's once vaunted name is put together with a lot more care.",3
"The story, characters and control system are all lacklustre, and even the sniper mode that regularly pops up for you to save a hostage from the grips of a terrorist is badly designed, as the times are too quick to clear the area and you end up with innocent blood on your hands.",5
"Age of Empires: Definitive Edition is a game stuck midway between the past and the present. The remastering process took a lot of work and turned out pretty good but I can't understand why the gameplay was left intact without any modern polish. At first, the nostalgia was strong but fighting with the archaic solutions over and over again for a few hours was too much for me and I got bored.",6
"The AI in the game has been greatly improved over last year. People who like to run the same few plays over and over will need to learn to change their game, or they will get left behind.",9
"As I paraded through the areas killing similar tiny enemies over and over (even the ""big"" monsters don't intimidate), it took forever to find any exciting rare items to wield. Without those incentives, things got monotonous. [March 2005, p.123]",7
"Just like most Paradox Interactive strategy games, Supreme Ruler: Cold War has become a very difficult game that is made for the best strategists out there. The lack of a tutorial doesn't help and the meagre graphics don't make the game any more accessible. However, if you're looking for a deep strategy game that can give you a big challenge, try it out.",6
"Boyfriend Dungeon is an impressive matchup of two genres that I’d never think would make a decent pair. It juggles interesting personal entanglements with challenging action gameplay via its dungeons. Though it could really benefit from some depth to its romantic structure, it’s not enough to sour what is overall a fascinating experience.",8
"If you’re a fan of the original Rock of Ages, you will absolutely love Rock of Ages 2: Bigger & Boulder. Rock of Ages 2 brings back everything that made the original so fun and unique, then cranks the dial to eleven.",9
"There's nothing at all wrong with arcade-style gameplay, but there's something wrong if the action is alternately dull and frustrating, as it is this game. If you're a Ducati devotee or fan of motorcycle racing, prepare for disappointment with this game.",4
"This arcade racer is filled to the brim with content. The singleplayer experience is extremely varied thanks to a large amount of available tracks and the multiplayer modes offers endless fun for all. To top it off, the game sells at a fair price means you really should give this title a shot. The only issue we encountered occasionally is a technical glitch which sometimes cause your vehicle to behave oddly from time to time. Luckily these occurrences are few and far between. Highly recommended.",8
"I knew The Gold Saucer was going to be a big moment in Rebirth, but nothing could prepare me for the cacophonous performance that broke out when I entered the gilded theme park: dazzling holograms, gyrating bodies, and a healthy dose of Terry Crews-esque Pec Popping. It was just one of nearly a dozen moments that had my jaw on the floor.",10
"If you meet along some trustworthy cooperative kleptomaniacs, a virtual world of Monaco will become your next home. This stealth multiplayer game loves its dollar bags the same way you do.",9
"But unless you have fond memories of Warlords' primitive arcade past, its gameplay is just too simplistic to offer more than a weak dose of transient wistfulness. [Sept 2008, p.77]",5
"Most traditional RPG fans will find themselves bored and frustrated with SaGa's extremely open-ended and unforgiving game design, but those select few who find themselves excited by these prospects will proclaim this one of the most satisfying experiences in recent memory.",2
"There are touches of flawed execution in Persona 4: Dancing All Night, but they do little to upset what is otherwise a spectacular rhythm game. Genuine strokes of genius can be found in its modifiable gameplay and superb soundtrack, and they're compelling enough to keep the game from solely relying on its buckets of patented Persona charm.",8
There’s no such game as “Perfect” but Madden NFL 10 and the development team over at EA Tiburon continues to offer the greatest football experience year after year. The Online Franchise and the possibility to play with a friend online are welcomed additions and the overall product is a must have for any Madden hardcore fan out there.,9
"A strong sense of black humour is prominent in the gameplay, the excellent story and the in-game banter, which keeps your interest in what would have otherwise been a run-of-the-mill third person adventure.",7
"A wonderfully drafted love letter to fans in terms of design, story aside. Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions was a risk. Beenox dropped the open-world environments for a linear experience, but it turned out for the best. Each universe feels almost completely different from the others in design and play.",9
"Sonic Rivals feels a little like a mini-game to a bigger game. We expected more content than this. The cards are utterly useless in their attempt to milk replay out of the title, and seemed thrown in at the last minute.",7
We would love to see Xbox Live support enabled with support for downloadable objects (this could help to extend the lifespan) or even custom soundtrack support to take advantage of the Xbox's capabilities would have been a good inclusion.,8
"South of Midnight is an incredible experience – and a rare fantasy adventure that grasps deeper themes whole-heartedly, telling a story that is cinematic, dynamic, beautiful, and heart-wrenching at every turn. What a wonderful world we live in, that games like South of Midnight exist.",10
"The Metronomicon comes together in a neat package which rhythm game fans will certainly get a deal of enjoyment out of. The soundtrack is varied, with highlights being songs from the likes of Perturbator, however it’s likely you will dislike just as many songs as you do like. Bringing in the RPG elements makes this game stand out from other rhythm games, and there’s enough here to keep you going through the end of the game and beyond.",7
"Despite quite a potential, Venetica takes elements from other different games mortifying all of them with a result that doesn't come even close to the quality level that an ambitious production needs to reach.",5
"Trek to Yomi is a solid and well-executed trip to a black-and-white tale of swords and souls, where a simple but satisfying gameplay is paired with a charming narrative that offers three different endings. Enemy and setting variety could be better, but overall this is a game worthy of your time.",8
A really fun title. I enjoyed the western setting as well as a couple of the twists that were in the story. In addition the fact that I can go through the campaign a second time and get a slightly different view of events is a great idea.,8
"Forza Horizon 5 accomplishes that which so many franchises try again, and again, but fail to do so: get better with each and every entry. Playground Games and Turn 10 Studio's magnificent display brings about one of the best racing games of all time to Microsoft. Is this 2021's GOTY?",10
"I would only recommend this game to die-hard fans of the point-and-click genre. For the company’s first published game on Steam, I feel this was too much of a moonshot. I praise them for being ambitious and it definitely has potential, but sadly, the only element lacking is the most important thing: fun.",6
"Like the other Hunter games, features a limp sound track, silly dialog, and giant swarms of monsters. It's also really meant to be played multiplayer; the person playing by themselves is likely to end up frustrated by the amount of baddies and the punishing difficulty of boss battles.",6
"Where Soldiers best succeeds, though, is in the visuals. This is one immensely detailed game. The various environments you’ll find in the game feature incredibly detailed structures and high-resolution textures, which will surely push your videocard.",8
"No matter how much muscle your car is pushing, the AI will always manage a way to gain up on you and take the lead. I felt as if I&#146;ve won a Nobel Peace Price when I finally beat the last race in Paris, and you will too.",10
"While obviously being influenced by games like Limbo, Monochroma has a flavor and story all its own. Monochroma is a good game at heart, but it's hidden under technical errors and gameplay flaws that gave me no end of frustration.",7
"Unbelievably fun once you settle in to the drift-focussed arcade racing, and at 800 MS Points/£7.99 it feels like good value for money, but it's not the perfect version of the game we hoped it would be.",8
"Beautiful to watch and entertaining to play, the game will draw you in and make you feel connected to your onscreen personas like few others. Serious sim fans should definitely give this game a test flight.",9
"Journey of a Roach has an interesting concept as well as some clever puzzles, but the novelty quickly wears out and all we're left with is a short game with a mostly unexplored idea.",5
"The Sojourn is a peaceful yet thought-provoking puzzle game with beautiful visuals. The only bits of story are told through dioramas, so it isn't spelled out for you. With a sense of wonder and interesting puzzle mechanics, you'll have a great time seeing how clever you truly are.",8
NOT for the faint of heart or Yu-Gi noobs. Konami made this one directly for its target audience and in doing so have created a fantasic and indepth RPG that will delight purveyors of the card game for many hours.,9
"The world is drab in this fourth Driver game and the missions are just plain boring, and with about 15 to 20 hours of gameplay, at least it's not excruciatingly long (nothing makes a mediocre game worse than making you trudge through it for 40+ hours to feel like you accomplished something).",7
"Although it's easy to pick up, Tropico 5 is a deep and complex strategy title which keeps things interesting by throwing ever-changing challenges in to the story structure to mix things up.",7
"RPG Maker FES fail to deliver a nice experience to beginners. Without a real tutorial, the game lacks of fundamental information to create something appealing, leaving the players bored and frustrated. It may give some satisfaction only to those who are already experienced with the series.",6
"EA should take a page out of FIFA's book here: focus on the game. Every iteration - pre-alpha onwards - sit down and play a full game, 15-minute quarters. If it feels 'right', then you're on the right path.",8
"This decision further cements the idea – given that the 1980s series has been localised in English in the past – that this is a very niche game, for an audience expected to have some attachment with the series, and that it is a very barebones package with all extraneous content cut for more characters and levels. As a result, it is difficult to recommend to audiences outside of fans of the series; nostalgia, or familiarity, will likely forgive many of the shortcomings.",5
"Resistance: Burning Skies is an excellent proof of concept. It is the tech demo that shows third-party publishers that first-person shooters can be achieved on the Vita hardware. It is by no means a crowning achievement. Instead, Nihilistic have opened the door for other, more accomplished developers to step through.",5
"Zen Pinball 3D is a polished experience that will please pinball and video game fans alike. Despite its conservative take on pinball, as compared to games like Devil's Crush, it still offers an enjoyable experience that is worth any 3DS owner's time.",9
"With some impressive titles already released this year, the Nintendo Switch continues its hot streak with Splatoon 2. This may seem like a bold statement but Splatoon 2 finds itself to be one of the best shooters available right now. Granted, it is hard to compare gritty AAA first-person shooters with Splatoon 2 but it's equally hard to argue against the aesthetically pleasing visuals, smooth framerate, polished gameplay, and pure fun of the game.",8
Rogue Heroes: Ruins of Tasos is a tribute to the Zelda saga with roguelite mechanics and even farming and fishing. It offers extraordinary multiplayer options that will delight classic adventurers looking for something old school on Nintendo Switch.,8
"Like a good diorama, Button City has a lot of fine detail. Sure the story is breezy and the characters are charming, but what about the games? What about the simple, engaging level design? I wish the sidequests were less about long walks, yes. I want a run button so very badly, it’s true. And the games could actually be harder. But I still want to visit this weird little town. I want to keep coming back to this arcade, I want to get sick of the only good games, I want to save up for the only good prizes. Whether you remember places like this or not, Button City is a delightful escape to the lost world of arcades. Heck, if you’ve got one in your town, this might convince you to start going again.",8
"Rock of Ages 2 is a typical ""more of the same"" and provides a lot of fun, until you discover that the dish gets empty in a little bit more than an afternoon. Surely, such a fortunate architecture should have deserved more content.",8
"Aside from the cultural tweaks, the other major improvement here is in the scale of the game. The mountain you're competing on is huge, and the better you get, the more of it you get to see. In places, it's downright beautiful. [Nov 2003, p.134]",10
You can compare playing Drakensang with reading of a good old classic book. Old-fashioned RPG acquired new graphics but its heart remains the same. Prepare to enter a lively and believable world filled with a plethora of quests and catching stories. [Mar 2009],8
"Capcom has gone a little bit experimental here, but what we have here, episodic or not, is a step in the right direction. We miss some puzzles, but there's some Resident Evil soul in this game.",8
"SingStar Ultimate Party is a party that's only half successful: you can still have fun (even lots of, in certain conditions), yet with different choices the outcome could have been far more memorable.",7
"The updated visuals and online functionality are welcome improvements, but if you've already spent hours nailing high scores and low times four years ago, the events haven't changed drastically enough to warrant two purchases.",7
"While Quarrel doesn't really do too much to push the word genre forward, it's really not that bad a game at all. While the AI has its moments of cheapness and the presentation could've used a little more ingenuity (and for that matter, lessened loading times), the game has a light-hearted appearance, gameplay that can really grow on you (especially if you're an English major) and online options to make it a real party.",8
"If Fall of Cybertron has one lesson that it's trying to convey, it's the same thing that players will quickly learn upon trying out the multiplayer mode: Keep moving, adapt, and be willing to change. Otherwise, you'll probably blow up.",9
"The game's puzzles provide plenty of challenge for amateur coaster designers, and the rating system gives you an incentive to continue working on tracks even after the basic requirements have been satisfied.",8
"Dead or School is a bit of a hidden and unpolished gem on the Nintendo Switch, but we found that its pros (battle system, level design and loads of contents) far outweigh the cons.",7
"This game contains three games. First of all the new part, Razing Storm and also the Arcade mode from Time Crisis 4 and the game Deadstorm Pirates. All of them are fun and are working great with the PlayStation Move controller.",7
"Monaco is a lot like Hotline Miami. The latter is a great ""psychedelic killing simulator"" while Monaco is probably one of the best ""burglar simulators"" out there. All it took was simple graphics, good ideas and excellent execution (and that meant many months of hard work). Monaco is a complicated machine that delivers chaos and fun at the player's wish. It's worth a shot!",9
"The multiplayer element, though far from its selling point, adds a welcome, manic element that amounts to icing on the cake. This, simply, 2D Mario at its best, and it's been a long time coming.",9
"The game is different, odd, colourful, and often funny, but it feels like step backwards from its predecessors in more ways than one. And sadly playing as Battle Cat just doesn't seem to fix it.",4
"A game that cannot satisfy City Builders lovers, nor RTS seekers. However it could please the youngest and those who would like to try the genre with something extremely light and undemanding.",6
"Axing every bit of multiplayer content -- not just the online modes -- from the original games is a baffling move on the part of the developers, considering that other Wii shooters have included both local and online multiplayer options.",3
"Dark Sector is a good game that has some great hooks, such as the wonderful glaive and a powerful shotgun. It's unfortunate that other elements, such as unpolished combat and some very generic NPCs, undermine its ambition (though they don't render the game unplayable).",7
"If you're still charmed in the slightest by the Dance Dance Revolution franchise, then Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 3 will likely put a big grin on your face, and if you're anything like me, it'll complement those unstylish dance moves just fine.",8
"Once the balancing had been fixed it could be a great team-based shooter, but its monetisation and unlock system will no doubt rub a lot of players to wrong way. That said, it’s free and a fairly small download, so it’s certainly worth a look, but time is running out to get things right with new competitors almost ready to steal the spotlight.",7
"Though GRIP offers up some exciting racing and vehicular combat on a really wild and creative set of tracks, a frustrating singleplayer campaign and serious technical issues with the online multiplayer make it difficult to recommend in its current state.",6
I was pleased to find that my six-year-old daughter had as much fun as I did playing the game. Although she became a bit frustrated at points (as I did) she still was able to manage to manipulate the pikmin the way she intended.,9
"Even though there are no huge steps forward from the previous episode, it manages to bring us everything we expected and some nice additions like the online multiplayer. It has everything you need to keep a party going.",8
"War of the Ring mode offers more persistence for units and greater movement allowance, and with the addition of the Thrall Masters and other useful evil units, this is a good expansion pack that does more than just hold the fort.",8
"Digging Strike's simplistic gameplay is both an asset and a weakness. Fans of old school games will really enjoy this lighthearted update, but gamers looking for deeper gameplay will be disappointed.",7
"Rollerdrome is a fantastic concept really well executed. There is still some room for improvement, hopefully for a sequel, but Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater fans have an interesting twist to the genre here they should try.",8
"The Time Crisis: Razing Storm compilation is a really mixed disc – for those seeking out a light gun game that implements the Move controller well, it will only be partially satisfying, given the weakness of Razing Storm's motion controls. Thankfully, the package is partially saved by the controls and fun factor of Time Crisis 4 and Deadstorm Pirates especially.",7
"Loop Hero has all the right ingredients for an adventure management game with roguelike systems. There’s a learning curve to tackle, but after a few runs, you’ll be piecing together the world in no time. The entire experience is cathartic in a way as you watch the world evolve from your actions and overcome its obstacles with a little skill and luck. Unlike what Devolver Digital advertised at the announcement, it may not be game of the year material, but it’s still worth giving it a try.",8
"There are a handful of good aspects to Throne and Liberty, but in their present state, they don’t do enough to elevate it over similar games in the genre. Most MMO players are pretty entrenched in their favorite games. When a new title comes along, it has to offer something special enough to draw players away from their current obsessions. This one just doesn't do that, at least not yet. Throne and Liberty lays a solid foundation, but it still has a long way to go.",6
"Riptide is an unimaginative rerun of the predecessors few strengths and many weaknesses. Sure, the game offers moments of zombie smashing fun online, but a horrible story-line and repetitive game play quickly turns the single player into a boring gorefest.",5
Ankh is a return to the days of graphic adventure. It offers a fast moving story with likeable characters and a good sense of humor. If only the game wasn't so short and easy it might actually be a worthy addition to your PC library.,7
"With the tight action carrying the game the majority of the way, this may well be a tough sell for those who aren’t into niche Japanese titles. However, for those who enjoy fluid combat and revel in the strange and the bizarre, this may well be exactly what Galen of Pergamon ordered.",6
"Nothing to object (save the anachronistic lack of the online multiplayer): Nintendo has created once again a magnificent product, an amazing party game with no barriers to entry nor annoying distinctions between casual and hardcore players. Prepare your Wiimotes and invite your friends: the legendary plumber is back with an old school adventure you won't easily forget.",9
"While a lot of Nickelodeon Kart Racers 3: Slime Speedway’s best and most improved aspects may be pulled from other racers, the quality jump between this one and its predecessor cannot be overstated. Slime Speedway is a confident, enjoyable and joyful party experience. The devs have finally hit the mark, delivering a great entry into the pantheon of mid-budget licensed games. Fans who are nostalgic for old cartoons and anyone with younger kids will definitely have a great time here.",8
"The Forbidden Arts is a nice indie studio entry for the Switch and good for at least 12 hours of gameplay. I say “at least” because if you play like me you will probably get a couple of extra hours out of it (refer to the finicky jumping bits above). It doesn’t have all the polish of a big studio game, but it has heart.",7
"It's clever, it's impressive and it's undeniably Nintendo. If you have children and a Nintendo Switch - and your children love being creative - then it's hard not to say it's essential. However, despite its undeniable charm, it's very niche, it's expensive and not for everyone.",8
"Each turtle has his own attacks and skills, plus his own unique set of stages, and it's all tied together with great looks and sounds that make TMNT feel like a really polished SNES game - not a bad thing at all from where I sit. [Nov 2003, p.100]",8
"There is fun and satisfaction to be had in stealthily taking out whole levels without being spotted, but that is perhaps due to the nature of stealth gameplay rather than the strengths of the game itself. If you are looking for something along these lines and don’t mind the issues too much, you may enjoy Filthy Lucre, but there are other games that do the same thing with more success for a similar price, making this particular game difficult to recommend.",5
"F1 2013 oozes quality, fully living up to the illustrious nature of its official licence, and the presence of the 1980s and 1990s cars, drivers and tracks gives motorsport nuts a real reason to buy it – which is much-needed for such an annual franchise.",8
"Whether you really wanted it this way or not, Age of Empires: Definitive Edition is about as pure of a remaster as you’re ever going to find. The visuals and sound are all upgraded for a modern era without changing the heart of the game. However, with the vastly superior Age of Empires II HD already in existence with five years of community built up around it, there is little reason to recommend this game unless you’re just dying to play extremely early era civilizations.",7
"It still has a definite 'one-more-go' appeal and thus the sense of satisfaction when you complete missions is immense. Whilst not quite as accomplished as the Medal Of Honor games, Crashdown is certainly recommended for those looking for a decent FPS treat.",8
"Anyone looking to get into the fighting genre would fare well here: it's not too technical at first, but offers enough gameplay and modes to turn you into a combo-mashing pro while keeping you entertained.",8
"A masterpiece of epic proportions. From the innovative battle system to new ways of leveling up; the game gets a hold of you and never lets go. With roughly 50-100 hours playtime, Final Fantasy XII is an experience that you’ll never forget.",10
"While X-Men Origins: Wolverine is clearly undercooked, it's still genuinely fun, and most importantly, it delivers the kind of visceral, untamed experience that fans expect from the character. It's been a long time coming. Just like Logan, it's a beast on the outside, but it has a good heart within.",7
"Turok 2: Seeds of Evil is a classic Nintendo 64 FPS that perfectly enraptures the charm of its era. Certain design decisions struggle to translate well to the modern times, however, rendering the act of shooting dinos feel fun in some areas but obtuse in others.",5
"Spend a few hours winding down with its carefree sandbox or just listen to the ever catchy folksy music, and it’s just the antidote you need after a bad day, a bad year, or hell, a bad decade.",8
"There's one thing that really distinguishes the EverQuest phenomenon from all pretenders to the throne, for better or worse&#151;difficulty. Slaving for weeks through one of the higher ""hell levels"" isn't just time-consuming, it's quite often toil.",9
"It's simple, yet deep; goofy, yet realistic. By straddling these contradictions, MLB Power Pros 2008 manages to appeal to casual and hardcore players alike. It doesn't step far from its predecessor's shadow, but that doesn't prevent it from shining.",8
"A surprisingly strong game that does so many of the fundamental things right. Smooth, colorful graphics, a respectable score, a working camera (I can't stress this enough), and a 15-20 hour action-adventure quest are good points for which almost any game should strive.",8
"The only real problem I had with the game is one you have to push ""A"" 71 consecutive times to pull that many Pikmin out of the ground, and with only 30 days this gets time consuming.",8
"A great porting of the original N64 title that pushes the New Nintendo 3DS hardware to the limit. A must-have for all the Zelda fans (but you already know that, right?) and for everyone looking for something great to put in their new console.",9
"Arma 3 demands much of the player's ability, forcing him to make the best possible experience. It is the player who has to entertain itself using the tools that Bohemia Interactive provided.",7
The concept is interesting: Who doesn't want to see themselves in a cow costume with a sunflower hat and a guitar on your back throwing kicks that are as deadly as they are elegant? Unfortunately the execution of that concept is far less interesting.,5
"Age of Wonders 4 is a fantastic entry in the Age of Wonders series, giving players freedom and choice. The game is so full of customization that it gives unlimited possibilities that no two games will ever be the same, nor would anyone want them to be.",9
"With its limited depth, Brave Soldiers can't hold its own against more technical fighters on the market, and the tedium and lackluster presentation of the story mode won't give anyone who's not already a fan of the series much of a reason to become one.",6
"Iro Hero already has its own identity, so there's no need to stray further from the pack by implementing so many strange design-decisions. Having to sit through several minutes of filler just for another crack at the real obstacle is not fun or challenging. This shmup is only recommended for those out there willing to put up with a lot of tedium.",4
"Monaco is an amazing co-op game. It works both as an arcade-style romp and as strategic game that rewards deep thinkers...If you don’t want to play with others, however, I would skip it.",8
"When Artificial Intelligence goes rogue, hacking is just what the doctor ordered. Evotinction is a mixed bag of stealth, action, and technology that sometimes struggles to stand on it's own circuit. However, the game is pretty solid with a good story at its foundation.",7
"The game is lacking lightness, is unclear and too forced. The original gameplay is surrounded by shallow innovations that make the game hard to like and undermine the new plot. [Issue#290]",4
"Although the lack of meaningful additions is obvious, Forza Horizon takes another step forward in the racing genre, offering a fun adventure in a beautiful world with plenty of things to do.",9
"Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIII is an old school strategic game hard to play on PlayStation 4 due to its complex interface. If you'll manage to survive the dull first impression, though, you'll find a deep and interesting game.",7
"Final Fantasy XIII-2, like its predecessor, takes bold chances that pay off in nearly every way. It is clear that the folks at SquareEnix have listened to their fans and have made a great many changes based on that feedback. While there are some aspects that could use some shoring up, Final Fantasy XIII-2 is very worthy of the mantle of this long-standing series.",8
"With a potentially unlimited number of user-designed maps that can be shared over Xbox Live and even user-generated stories with scripted AI events, this game has the longevity of Rasputin and should spawn one of the liveliest online communities yet. [Official UK Xbox Magazine]",8
"Guardian Heroes is one of the best HD remake of this generation. The awesome original game is now sharper and more balanced, with tons of new options and brand new controls. At the price of 800 Microsoft Points, you MUST buy it and enjoy its greatness!",9
"You will be hard pressed to find a better action game on the GBA. The fact that the game features Astro Boy is actually a bonus. Anyone that likes action and robots, (and who doesn't?) is certain to enjoy Astro Boy: Omega Factor.",9
"It can be too repetitive at times and too easy for gamers looking for challenge. However, the spooky theme and familiar Disney settings will make Haunted Mansion an enjoyable diversion for many.",7
"The core idea for The Settlers: New Allies is evidently a good one, but oversimplification of certain aspects of this famous series - while simultaneously trying to go back to the roots - was a mistake. Apparently, even Ubisoft didn't fully believe in its success as it didn't advertise the game at all.",6
Huge and extremely ambitious strategy with exceptional attention to detail. In other words this is not a game for common gamers – it consumes great amounts of time and requires absolute attentiveness. [Issue#208],7
"If you’ve ever pictured yourself fighting corruption with an arsenal of shotguns in a loopy environment that’s reminiscent of a NyQuil hallucination, then High Hell is for you. Fast-paced, sick beats, shiny graphics, unlimited ammo, arcade shooter… need I say more?",7
"Monster Energy Supercross 25 is a tough to pick up, but rewarding to learn racing sim. The new physics, courtesy of Unreal Engine 5, makes this iteration of the series more realistic than ever, with ever-evolving track surfaces that make every lap different and exciting with each new attempt. The career mode is nothing to write home about compared to most other modern sports or racing titles, and the inclusion of a training mode doesn't do the best job of getting new riders up to speed. Still, the racing is fun and can be quite thrilling once you get your bearings, and the idea of virtually endless user tracks to test out is a cool idea if players take advantage of it. The modes present in the game are solid enough, but don't have a ton of variety to keep you around forever. Still, if you have the patience to learn the ropes or are a long-time fan of the series, 25 is a worthy addition to your racing sim collection.",7
"It's a quick thrill – a little bit of fiery eye-candy and raw destruction to pass the time – but as its explosions grow more tiring, there's little else to see among the streets of Shatter Bay, and its focus is clearly muddled. While Unbounded is no doubt a step in the right direction for the franchise, perhaps it was a little early to leave the safety of Ridge City behind.",6
"I do wish there had been a bit more after four years of waiting. It's like rediscovering a long lost friend, and while he&#146;s still the same lovable guy, it turns out he hasn't matured much or traveled around Europe in the intervening years. He simply never left home.",8
"It is a bit disappointing not being able to choose which year you time travel to or see your own little town in the future, but apart from that The Sims 3: Into the Future is a very fun expansion to this lovely videogame. Especially the plumbots and the dream pod are nice features.",8
"If you’re looking for something that’s a bit more mild as far as mechanics, but not necessarily as battle focused as Dynasty Warriors from the same studio, I would actually recommend Samurai Warriors 4: Empires which takes aspects from both franchises. But if you do want a fully thought focused war simulation game that will make you question every move and have noticeable future consequences set in a historically accurate Asian period, RTK13 is the only valid choice currently available.",8
"The Last Story definitely deserves to follow in the footsteps of Xenoblade Chronicles, appealing to RPG fans everywhere, tapping into what makes the classics, such as Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy so addictive, namely a strong focus on story with good pacing and a fluid battle mechanic that works almost flawlessly throughout the adventure.",9
"I found the overall experience to be a little underwhelming. It's fun for a short rhythm game, but with only 12 levels, it felt like Laserlife never really got a chance to fully explore the broad topics it brought to the table.",6
"Everspace provides some of the most unique experiences I’ve had in gaming this year, and it does so with style, featuring awe-inspiring visuals and intense gameplay, all without the budget and support of a AAA publishing studio.",9
"Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate takes a previously released title back to the gym, worked out some known kinks in its system, adds in some new flavors of game play, pushes the total roster to 29 fighters, takes the best parts from the PS Vita version, and repackages it in a way that should draw in new fans, all the while pleasing long time fans of the series.",7
"As a survival horror game, it doesn’t add much to the genre but as a Resident Evil game, it changes up quite a bit of things to keep the series fresh and relevant, which is something it desperately needed.",8
"Save some rare problems with Danny’s jumps and the viewing of very complex levels do crop up, but they’re few and far between, and they hardly mar the impressive, challenging and marvelously-presented experience.",8
"A laidback RPG that is geared more towards the visual novel crowd. It has a charming group of characters trying to save the world, and a story that can pull on the heartstrings. Tedious combat design severely hampers the pacing of an otherwise fine story, and a lack of exploration and side-quests reduces the want of additional playthroughs.",7
Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood is in every way much better than its predecessor. It's just an excellent game in the first person shooter genre with a nice setting. Therefore this game is meant for everyone who's just looking for a little variation in this genre.,8
"Fate/Extella is a solidly-built Warriors-style brawler with a unique sense of speed and a sweet, engaging story. It would’ve been more impressive if it took about half as long to finish, though. Its distinctiveness is spread far too thin, battered into oblivion by endless repetition. Fans of Fate seeking a worthy coda to the story of Fate/Extra will find it here, but it’d be best to engage with the game in short bursts, rather than have it wear out its welcome over long sessions.",6
"One of the greatest JRPGs of the last 20 years. An amazing love letter to the original and all fans, that will make hours fly while you explore the open areas and play the mini-games, always with the main story on your head. The little visual problems do not take the shine away from this brilliant star.",10
"There is enough variety to the missions that the game will keep you challenged to the end. If you're looking for a change of pace from your typical strategy game, give Emergency Fire Response a look.",8
"Everything is not perfect but as far as movie games go this is simply put one of the best out there. Any fan of the X-Men universe should give the game a chance, but those who have been waiting for a Mature version of Wolverine to come around should rush out and pick X-Men Origins: Wolverine as soon as mutantly possible.",8
"Origins can be a lot of fun, but the game lacks freshness and boldness. The mechanics turn out to be underdeveloped and glaring with numerous bugs. Commandos fans will find something to enjoy here, but it is not the refreshing breath the genre needed.",6
"It’s a testament to the quality of Turok 2: Seeds of Evil and the great enhancements made by Nightdive Studios that this remaster is still an essential chapter of FPS history – more so than its rough-around-the-edges predecessor. Every gun still feels incredible, every level still looks unique in its design and the bosses and enemies are still a riot to hunt down and slay. But the bizarre amputation of the game’s multiplayer modes renders the Switch version painfully incomplete. Until support for multiplayer is patched in or addressed in some shape or form, we’re forced to give this N64 classic a score it doesn’t deserve.",6
"Double-Dash doesn't stray far from what gamers have come to love about the series -- if it aint' broke, don't fix it -- but the added refinements make it a must-play title, particularly with friends.",10
"After all of the hype about the story, the Death Jr. comic book, and the upcoming film, one would think that the actual game would include a kick @$$ story, but that's just not the case. There's a neat opening cut scene, but past that there's nothing worth checking out.",6
"At the end of the day, should you add this game to your Nintendo Switch? Uh, yeah. It’s a fun game that has some depth right out of the gate. In addition, and this is the perspective of a parent, if your kids have never played online battles before, then this is a game to start them on. The innocence of the game is there, as is the Nintendo assurance that your kids aren’t going to rage quit. That’s always a good thing to avoid, especially when your console is basically a high-end tablet (I mean that with respect, Nintendo fans). Anyway, drop the dough and grab this game. It’s quality.",8
"Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions is not exactly a sort of compilation where you can find 4 games in 1, but it's a long and entertaining product that every fan of Spidey should try.",8
If you are looking for some easy achievements then this is worth renting but if you want “fun” playing against your friends/family locally or the world on Xbox Live then this game is certainly worth picking up.,6
"Metro: Last Light is a hugely atmospheric FPS that has corrected all the real flaws of its predecessor and improved on them to such a degree that they’re actually superb – stealth and shooting are now things to enjoy rather than avoid, and can compete with the best in the genre.",8
"While the beginning is almost everything you could wish for from a classic horror experience, Wilson’s Heart soon loses itself in uninteresting “explore, pick up, use, repeat”. It still shows how effective subtle horror can be in VR even though it never gets to prove it fully.",7
"A Space for the Unbound is an ode to teenage nonchalance, and an emotional lesson in learning to let go, all wrapped up in a story about a superpowered calamity. Its disparate parts thoughtfully work together to create a heartfelt story, full of characters you won't want to say goodbye to.",8
"Jurassic World Evolution claims a victory of sorts in being the best ""big-budget"" simulator currently available on Nintendo Switch, though it cruised through there on the back of the port of Cities: Skylines being less than ideal. The fact that the game has a deep library of DLC built into the package certainly boosts its value, and when the only other options are the indies like Project Highrise or ports of the old Rollercoaster Tycoon titles, it's nice to have an option like Evolution for on-the-go play, though I am hoping that the port of Tropico 6 - a much more complex and detail-orientated simulator - proves to be the big one for the console. Jurassic World Evolution is enjoyable, but a little too simple to hit the peaks of the genre.",7
"Shovel Knight Showdown offers a decent multiplayer fighting game experience. Fans of the series will probably fall in love with this alternative way to play with Shovel Knight, but the old-school style and heavy platforming hurt its general appeal.",6
"It’s the best-looking game across all three platforms (yes, even over The Witcher 3), but more importantly it just delivers in every aspect you could hope for. It’s challenging and engaging, expansive and enticing. Its game-world is wholly realised and gorgeous to look at, but above all else, it tells such an incredible story in so many new and unique ways, it’s impossible to ignore.",10
"The personality of Revita shines through its 16-bit art style. A clear ode to greats of the past, the game possesses large sprites that have a ton of character. The blue-haired protagonist has a simple but memorable design that is in line with games of the era. This is further amplified with its retro-inspired soundbites. With its catchy melodies and general effects, the game perfectly captures the feel of the 90s.",8
"There are many reasons why Loop Hero is an amazing game, such as the combination of different mechanics from different genres, setting up the road and your camp as if it were a strategy game, building our hero as if it were an RPG and the story, very similar in storytelling to graphic adventures of yesteryear. All of this makes a combo that everyone should enjoy.",10
"A Total War Saga: Troy is an exciting and interesting addition in a series that has been running for 20 years now. Fun mechanics that make every faction unique makes for campaigns that we seldom see in other Total War-games, and the stunning visual style makes the game a joy to play.",8
"Reality Fighters is an unmitigated disaster. It begins with a questionable concept and meets a fiery, disastrous end at the hands of poorly implemented AR and botched fighting mechanics. If you are looking for proof that AR is the future, look on.",2
"There's not really much else I can add to those two reviews for this Nintendo Switch release, but Goichi Suda and NISA bringing these two visual novel classics together to the Nintendo Switch is a good thing. Both are magnificent examples of what can be done to give games a literary quality, and going forward, no study of crime fiction or noir could be complete without considering The Silver Case up there with the likes of The Big Sleep or Chinatown. Japan actually has a very deep tradition in noir storytelling, and this is an excellent introduction to it.",9
"This new game in the Warhammer universe does a lot of things better than the most popular representative of the genre, Left 4 Dead. Loot system and clear differences between characters are big advantages, but the most important is the emphasis on melee combat - Vermintide puts us much closer to the action.",8
"A deeper, better game than ""Naval Ops: Warship Gunner,"" an RTS-lite with gobs of replay value...I just hope the next entry in the series addresses its weak graphics and lack of multiplayer.",8
"Forza Horizon 5 is not an innovation, but its excellent quality makes it one of the best racing games even if it is conservative. It's a place of speed and limit, of wildness and freedom, which makes adrenaline soar all the time.",10
"Rather than a full blown sequel, Splatoon 2 frankly feels more like an (impressive) extension of the original episode, especially if you've been splatting around since 2015. Players of the Wii U chapter will truly feel at home, with a sense of familiarity that will certainly replace the stunning surprise effect that made the franchise so unique, while the newcomers will have the pleasure to experience one of the best and most original shooters ever created (one the perfectly embodies the so called “Nintendo Difference”). That said, with more courage and better online options this sequel would have been even more impressive.",9
"It is a challenging game that demands precision and patience to master and in exchange it delivers tense, thrilling racing. It isn't perfect, but it's a step in a great direction for the franchise.",8
"Pitfall's main game is very short, as I blazed through it in seven hours. While it does have a few secrets, such as the ability to play as Nicole and the unlockable Pitfall games you can find in a shrine near your starting point (complete with a giant Mayan monument to the Atari 2600), Pitfall is still a bit on the brief side.",9
"Roki is undoubtedly one of the most engrossing games of the year. While the gameplay may at times contradict its perfectly nuanced story, it’s often easy to overlook and be swept away on a magical adventure full of mystery, heart and tragedy.",8
"Old Gods Rising is unsettling. It does a wonderful job of making you uneasy, constantly convincing you you’re being watched by someone or something, which the story is happy to suggest. If you want a game with a story which has multiple twists, an ambiguous ending, a nice sense of creepiness (without playing a horror game) and a fun, small insight into ancient civilisations and the gods they worshipped, Old Gods Rising maybe for you. Although, I’d wait for it to be a bit more stable if I were you.",5
"The Silver Case 2425 may contain some of SUDA51’s oldest work, but that doesn’t stop it from feeling like a fun, fresh, and (appropriately) frightening experience for those who have yet to play it (and even those who already have!). If you haven’t delved into the world of SUDA51 and want to check this game out, just know that you’ll be getting into something wonderful and weird, and that it’s not going to be your fault if you find yourself not understanding everything at first. And if you DO know what SUDA51 is all about… well, then, enjoy.",8
"Ultimately, Immortal: Unchained serves to highlight one thing above all else. Every frustrating aspect of the Dark Souls experience is tolerated and even praised by its fans because the underlying combat system is so fantastically well-realised...Strip that away and all you’re left with is a mediocre exercise in frustration. Immortal: Unchained has thrown guns into the mix, but no consideration has been given to how their addition might affect the classic Souls formula. Dark Souls but with bad combat is a tough sell.",4
"A perfect match for those looking for a cooperative game that reminds them of Left 4 Dead, but with its own style and brand new features. Maybe it's not the most detailed or varied game out there, but it's pretty fun.",8
"The groundhog day style repeating story was so promising and yet it has been produced in such a terrible fashion. There are plenty of good elements to the dungeon crawling, yet the levels themselves are dull and frustrating. A big disappointment.",4
The enemy AI is just as poor as the pathfinding AI. The enemy will send troops at you singly and in pairs allowing you to make short work of them. Even after you've spent half the mission killing off the enemy's solo suicide attacks it doesn't catch on and continues to waste its troops one by one.,4
"Doom meets the roguelike genre and the result is a very fine game, proving that the demonic invasions and sci-fi atmosphere of id Software's masterpiece can work wonders even with a totally different gameplay.",8
"But Movies is a videogame, not an acting studio; it's the game parts that wear thin, becoming more tedious than fun. Ultimately, Movies is that type of game you only bring out at parties, and even then, your guests will probably ask to play Rock Band or Guitar Hero instead.",6
"Despite the fact not everything is perfect about the game, MotoGP 13 turns out to be very realistic at some points. The fans will eat it up and new players will have a good challenge.",8
"X-Men Origins: Wolverine is not a game for everyone; you have to have a strong stomach, you have to like hack and slash games and you have to know the story of Wolverine to fully appreciate it.",8
"The Vita version of Ultimate Marvel Vs Capcom 3 is really impressive. The graphics are as sharp and stunning as the one in the original version of this crazy fighting game. The new touch mechanics are kind of useless, though, but the final experience is still very good.",8
"The new countering system (realistically, the old one) is better, the environments are fantastic, and the addition of online play makes this game fuller than all of its predecessors.",9
New players are likely to feel totally lost in a sea of hostile troops and jittery unresponsive allies who can walk through walls but not fire through hedges. Not a game for the uninitiated.,4
"Mini Motorways is a surprisingly ambitious game for its scope. It executes a simple yet remarkably thoughtful premise and largely achieves great results. In everything from its visual style to its gameplay, Mini Motorways is broadly accessible, and smartly introduces the player to increasingly complex scenarios. Even though it doesn’t quite match the design perfection of something like Tetris, that’s still a pretty remarkable comparison to inspire.",8
"Though it’s not a bad game, Forgotten Fields is hampered by more than a handful of technical issues. Prepare to glitch through furniture and objects as you try and make your way around this otherwise beautiful world. It’s a shame, because there are more than a few truly lovely moments, and you’ll likely find yourself relating to the game’s cast of characters. Perhaps wait until its bugs have been addressed, because there’s a good story to be experienced here.",5
"Despite minor annoyances with the level system and the occasional free-running glitch, Darksiders II is superior to its predecessor in every way. It's got a larger, deeper world with a wide breadth of characters, a thrilling story that sucks you in and doesn't let go, and some insane over-the-top combat. All those elements make this a must-have for fans of action-RPGs.",9
"It's very much an assumed systems-first approach that won't resonate with all fans of the series. But if you count among those who fancy sinking deep into the innards of how everything works, you'll find a lot to love.",8
"An impressively enjoyable take on the Trials formula that'll appeal to those who find Trials too frustrating. However, if you take your dirt bike tricks seriously then you should stick to the classics.",8
"I just wish the gameplay had evolved more. It feels pretty familiar to me, but those who haven't played every tactical shooter in hte last couple years will find a fresh and exciting experience. [Jan 2005, p.130]",8
"The promise of those old, grand, globe-trotting Final Fantasy epics from the series’ 16- and 32-bit heyday in AAA form has been fulfilled at last. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth finally realizes the series’ central, implicit potential, looking to the past to pave the way for hopefully the start of a new golden age for the series.",10
"Even if you're not a huge comic book or Spider-Man fan, you could do a hell of a lot worse than to grab Shattered Dimensions and play through it before the ""real"" fall season of game releases starts.",9
"If you’re hungry for more Game of Thrones content and can’t wait until the next season or book, then Telltale’s Game of Thrones is the perfect game to pass the time. It weaves an interesting narrative that intersects with the franchise’s main plot while still poking into unexplored corners. Unfortunately, there’s a distinct lack of any real choice, and a hugely disappointing ending leaves the story hanging on a sour note.",7
"While I admittedly became less enamored with Monaco as it ramped up its difficulty and turned some of its later missions into tedious exercises in trial-and-error, the vast majority of Monaco's content is simply a delight to play, especially when enjoyed alongside a rogue's gallery of your most deviously skilled friends. It may not best serve the solitary brand of player, but for a cooperative group of would-be thieves, Monaco can be terrific fun.",8
"It&#146;s steep and it&#146;s fast. It not only looks great but it will make your stomach feel like you&#146;re on a elevator. The graphics are realistic, and the perspectives are virtually perfect enough to consider this game a sim.",9
"Riptide does a great job as a co-operative action game and it tastes best played with friends. If someone is still hungry for some zombie slashing after having finished the original Dead Island, Riptide will provide same fun enriched with some new equipment and fresh gameplay mechanics. Unfortunately it repeats most of the mistakes of the predecessor. [CD-Action 06/2013, p.48]",7
"Truly, I think the good folks at Deep Silver are a talented bunch, capable of making great games. Seeing them relegated to porting a mediocre game from the mobile devices instead of creating a new title that would better showcase their talent as well as the strength of the platform is a shame indeed. If you’ve been waiting for a quality game to fill that void until Star Fox makes a return on the Switch, you best keep waiting.",4
"Valkyria Revolution is not a bad game by any means, but fails big when trying to reflect the essence of the Valkyria Chronicles series in a genre that doesn't suit it at all like Action. Yeah, it offers a functional gameplay and interesting strategy mechanics, but in the end none of them work that well nor capture the magic that made the original Chronicles trilogy become a cult among gamers.",7
"It’s quirky enough and happy enough to win over all but the most hardened of hearts, and unless you believe games should be serious business at all times, it’s well worth checking out.",9
"Rock of Ages II: Bigger and Boulder is a fun title that just about pulls off its strange cocktail of genres. The Monty Python-like presentation is executed well and suits the game’s off-the-wall appeal, and its trio of modes and online or offline multiplayer give the game some legs beyond the story. Moreover, the gameplay offers a lot of potential for daft fun despite some sluggish boulder controls and frustrating AI balance issues. If you’re after something different, or enjoy some cathartic destruction in your games, you’ll have a ball.",7
"If Super Mario RPG helped you become a master of timing-based moves, Ikenfell offers a warm and satisfying playthrough. Undoubtedly, though, some will find the non-combat elements overly simple and the battles too demanding.",7
"On a hand-held, you'd think ""well done chaps, this is a good boiled-down version which keeps the core of the game intact"". But on a console, and so soon after Black Flag, it feels like an over-long chunk of watery DLC.",6
"A Space for the Unbound delivers its story of domestic/school violence (and overcoming it!) with its own imagination and well written characters. The tiny little details in the game that introduce Indonesian culture not only showed the developers' affection for their home country, but also made me want to know more about the country.",9
"The simplicity of Knights and Bikes lies within its need to revisit your childhood and remind you how much fun life can be, even when the storms are intense. It brings a great narrative to the table, throws some fun puzzles in the mix while delivering beautifully playful visuals that request you go on an adventure with a good friend. The game’s intentions of stupid fun might outweigh its execution, but it succeeds in capturing the imagination and delivering a fun experience that doesn’t take itself too seriously.",8
Clockwork Tales of Glass and Ink will last players around 3 or 4 hours depending on how fast puzzles are figured out or how much abuse the hint system gets. It’s best to just get absorbed into the world they created and figure it out as best players can.,8
"If you’ve done all there is to do in the multiplayer part of Splatoon 3, have gotten bored of it, or just fancy partaking in some singleplayer content, Side Order has you covered. It packs brilliant story content, stunning visuals and gameplay that’ll keep you hungry for more even when you’ve rolled the credits.",9
"To fully enjoy Ar nosurge you have to 1) read an exhaustive summary of its prequel's plot which never came to the West and 2) completely suspend your disbelief. Once you are done, you will find a deep and solid jRPG below multiple levels of fan service and oddities.",7
"I don't know how this game will do in the sales charts, but personally it's turned me from a music-game-weary cynic into a fresh-faced jammer once again. I'm not sure how long that will last, but for now I'm loving it.",10
"Despite its budget pricing and great humor, this game is hardly up to the great standards for budget titles set by Raze's Hell. However, if you are an Evil Dead or Bruce Campbell fan you should pick this up right now.",7
"Absolute Power is made for those who loves the original Tropico 3. The developers didn't want to shake foundations, but it doesn't mean that this expansion is not worth its $19.99.",7
"Real Boxing has a lot of the core fundamentals in place. It has customizable fighters, training mini-games, a career mode and competent multiplayer online matches. Unfortunately, the whole thing is marred by simplistic controls, cheesy animation and computer opponents that don't put up much of a fight. The groundwork is done, but Real Boxing comes up short of the KO!",7
"Sine Mora, the beautiful SHUMP from Grasshopper Manufacture, returns to PC and current-gen consoles in a remastered enhanced version called Sine Mora EX. There are a few add-ons that will bring back old players, above all the inclusion of local co-op multiplayer and some versus two player modes. This game is a must for shoot ‘em up 2D hardcore fans, but at the same time is enjoyable from everyone, and it finally comes also in retail version.",9
"As a first foray, it is an incredibly impressive effort from Creative Asselby Sofia, a team that has done incredible justice to one of the most important tales of the ancient world.",9
"Critter Café takes you to a colourful world that mixes modernity with fantasy. Not only are you operating the magical animal café of your dreams, but you also get to escape reality and go on an adventure to save critters. However, unlike other restaurant-based cozy games, there’s a missed opportunity to offer more interactive opportunities outside the café operation and the exploration of the ruins, making the game feel a bit boring, lifeless, and repetitive.",6
"Romancing SaGa will please those gamers who want a very long game. There are many locations to discover and explore, and each is delightfully designed, although the tedium of fighting the same kinds of monsters may get in the way of leveling up.",6
"After cameoing in multiple fighters over the years, Shovel Knight finally has one to call his own with Shovel Knight Showdown. While the combat system is very basic, Shovel Knight fans should still find some fun here with friends and even the first few times through the game's arcade ladder.",6
"The mechanics are competent, but it is the characterisations, especially the wooden delivery of some lines, that let the game down. On the plus side, the ample options include a story mode, multiplayer clash modes and a mission designer to open up replay values.",8
"A refreshing challenge in the genre of real-time strategy games that started with games like Warcraft, and it does its best to provide da gamer with a powerful, fully featured, intuitive control interface for commanding all those units.",10
"It’s a flawed great game. The battle system is fast and fun, yet it’s a bit simple and repetitive. The license board provides non-linear character growth, yet there aren’t that many ways to raise the characters. The towns feel alive and outdo anything to date, yet the dungeons feel all too similar and repetitive. [JPN Import]",9
"Given the constraints of the sport, SSX 3 does a great job of keeping the game as open as possible. If nothing else, the SSX series represents something of a benchmark for snowboarding games, a trend that continues with this instalment. No one title of this generation can claim obvious superiority. [Dec 2003, p.102]",7
"Knights & Bikes was created by a small team featuring several people who worked on LittleBigPlanet and Tearaway, and you can feel that all these games share a similar creative vision. There's a kind of wide-eyed, rough and tumble spirit of adventure running through all three games that is hard to resist. Knights & Bikes is a wonderfully warm, effortlessly inviting experience that'll make you feel young again.",8
The A.I. is better than average and will get tougher when you start getting to some of the hot games. A good selection of menus and helpful suggestions. The game teaches you as much as you are willing to learn.,8
"Thanks to the thoughtfully designed courses, tight control, and -- thank goodness -- a battery backup and autosave feature, Racing Gears Advance is a pleasure to play from start to finish line.",9
"At the end of the day, Unbound is one of the best racing games this year, and the return of Criterion has proved to be the winning card for EA. It’s a fun game to play, there’s no doubt about it, and proper support for new-gen consoles means it could stay around for quite a long time.",9
"The conclusion the plot hurtles toward you may not be one you saw coming (I didn't), but the satisfaction of getting there cancels out all the tufts of hair you ripped out along the way working out the tougher puzzles.",8
"It's not as emotionally deep as other games on the market, it's not a 30 hour + epic and it's not art in video game form, but is arguably the greatest action game ever created. In a year full of incredible games, Gears of War 2 sits triumphantly at the very top.",10
"Only for story fans: The dark role-playing game scores with its strong setting and a decent plot. However, exploration and combat wear out quickly, and a lot of potential is wasted in detective work.",7
"Thirteen steps forward, two steps back? Final Fantasy XIII-2 resolves most of the main problems that the first game had, while introducing a number of new ideas, of which a few feel underwhelming or completely out of place. The characters, visuals, story are engaging and the narrative better told. It will be a hard sell for skeptics of the first game, but for fans it's an essential play.",8
"Simply put, this title's characters, plot, and dialogue are hackneyed and verging on painful. Every joke falls flat, and every plot twist seems scraped from the bottom of Indiana Jones' barrel. [Apr 2004, p.91]",6
"With one episode of Just Dance every year, it's obvious that you can not expect many changes for each of them now. Even if Just Dance 2014 is one of the best games you can share in a party, the IP is kind of stuck in its concept since Just Dance 3. Beware of the burnout.",8
Even though the Definitive Edition is a beautiful reimagining of a classic and definite RTS it doesn’t go the extra step to modernize the gameplay or at least fix several issues existing in the 1997 version. The nostalgia factor can drive the experience so much before remembering ultimately the several limitations of this old pioneer.,6
"It's easy to write Khazan off as just another Soulslike at a glance, and it would be refreshing to see Neople create its own style and structure instead of just imitating a popular convention. However, Neople went further than most Soulslikes and actually innovated with its take on the genre's combat. That's a big positive, seeing as there's not much else to Khazan outside of battle, but at least all the time spent in combat is enjoyable.",7
"Without any major changes other than a slight visual and physics update, Madden NFL 25 is still a great sports game. Even without direct competition, it delivers a complete experience for fans, and only for them.",8
"The game has definitely been created for fans of this series but unfortunately on the XBox 360, it feels more like an iPhone or iPad game with its dual controls. It's enough to pass a few hours but don't expect anything too indulging unless you're a true fan.",8
"The inability to upload high-scores is a minor disappointment, but otherwise Bit.Trip Void is an unqualified success, and for 600 Points from the Wii Shop it's well worth investigating.",8
"From a silly laugh track sound effect playing back when Scoob & Shaggy get into (or out of) trouble to the sight of obviously rubber-suit monsters nearby, &#147;Night of 100 Frights&#148; delivers the sights, sounds and goofy things that made the Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning cartoon such a timeless hit.",7
"Slathered with infectious energy, its innovative alternate-reality heartbreak shooting mechanics are thrilling to play with, and it's a world you won't want to say farewell to after you get your first ending. Resident Evil 4 and Silent Hill can't match this neon-soaked survival horror for its sheer inventiveness.",9
"If you're a big fan of these niche style games, then it should be right up your alley. Nothing else about Chaos Wars really stands out, the graphics are 2D on a 3D plane, and look well enough, but the music isn't really exceptional stuff.",6
"At some point — I can’t say exactly when — my interactions with the GamePad screen became natural and intuitive, an organic part of the game that I didn’t find myself consciously thinking about. It just felt normal and fun. This is a crucial step forward in changing players’ perception of the GamePad from novel gizmo to worthwhile, game-enhancing peripheral.",8
"An average adventure game with mediocre graphics and a hero who looks like he could use his own professional help (he's a shrink). On the other hand, dark story with a psychological twist, eerie piano music and screams of tortured girls in the background might do the trick for you, if you're into that kind of... entertainment. [June 2008]",7
"Taking cues from its contemporaries, particularly Metal Gear Rising Revengeance, Grasshopper’s hack and slash tale of moon power and misogyny is an entertaining diversion, particularly narratively and artistically, but its gameplay unfortunately lacks the inventiveness or ingenuity to see it mature into a truly timeless action game.",7
"The use of different classes and the evocation of the Warhammer setting is enough to make Vermintide a competent twist on the Left 4 Dead formula, but it doesn't execute them well enough to live up to its inspiration.",7
"The control is sublime, the camera is perfectly placed. The vaunted variety of snow-types is no gimmick either - it's an incredibly palpable, almost physical, experience. [Nov 2003, p.71]",9
"Graphically gorgeous, especially when you crank up its brilliant dynamic weather effects, F1 2013 reproduces every car and track from the current season in stunning detail (making the game’s short, non-savable replays even more perplexing).",8
"Its faster-paced take on the Gears of War formula, coupled with the novelty of the bladed glaive mechanic, pull Dark Sector above the mire of mediocre shooters that it could so easily have become.",8
"With a distinct and interesting artstyle, which mixes a realistic car and city with streetart cartoon drawings for special effects, NFS Unbound definitely sets itself apart from the rest. The game sports a Souls-like mechanism of risk vs reward and a day-night cycle that work, but also hinders progress through the storyline. the races are fun and the many collectibles are well integrated. The near-mandatory police chases quickly become a nuisance and we wouldn't mind if those didn't make a return.",8
"Tropico 3 is a good game even though similar to the first episode (played eight years ago). There are some improvements, but is very similar than the first episode. Despite it, Tropico 3 is an exciting game that requires you a good dedication.",8
"Offers a wide variety of things to do, but no real direction in a lot of important areas. Romancing SaGa is ultimately a role-playing game with a lot of gameplay substance but no cohesive storyline to back it up.",7
"Forza Horizon 5 is the best Forza yet and, not only that, but it also makes a strong case for being the best racing game period. A joyous combo of arcade racing and simulation-level depth, all wrapped up in a beautiful bow thanks to its diverse, expansive Mexico setting, this is an unmissable iteration in what is arguably gaming’s most consistently fantastic series.",10
"Despite its propensity for insignificant plot points, I can’t wait to play Dead Island Riptide again. I’ll return for the desperate bid for survival, and stay for the stories that emerge as a result.",8
"The game isn't much more than your typical ""Final Fight"" or ""Double Dragon"" type of game, but it's a pretty satisfying gaming experience...especially for those who dig the Turtles. But you just can't ignore the fact that the game's irritatingly short.",7
"I feel the game is lacking in direction. It feels like a make-work project with too-similar objectives and the putting of parts together. As far as I'm concerned, this game is just a piece of ship.",5
"It's somewhat flawed, but SimCity Creator still has the core elements that make the SimCity franchise a joy. For those of you who have watched your speck of a city swell into a metropolis know what I'm talking about. And those of you who haven't, well, now would be a good time to start!",7
"As is so often the case in this genre, the minigames miss as many pitches as they hit. We'd actually recommend the Xbox predecessor over this one, if it didn't suffer horrible performance problems when running on the 360.",6
"While the Nerf fad may be over, this game is actually quite solid and should be able to keep younger players satisfied for a couple months before the latest toy comes out. If anything, you want to pick this up because the gun it comes with is pretty awesome.",7
"As such it is hard to recommend The Waylanders in its current form. Although it is charming and enthusiastic, its slapdash quality seriously hampers the overall quality of the experience. A middling narrative and minor bugs are easy to overlook if the overall game is enjoyable - which The Waylanders is - but potentially game-breaking issues will erode any good will the title may have gained.",4
"It would have scored 9+ easy with a fleshed out story and engaging multi-player, but as it stands you get a truly visceral and enjoyable single-player action romp that will satisfy any fan of the genre.",8
"By enforcing a system of communication and bond development amongst its characters, Ar nosurge: Ode to an Unborn Star achieves what great novels and only the most lovingly crafted virtual experiences can: it offers the opportunity to not only interact with the characters but to, possibly, form memorable relationships with them as well.",9
"Seafaring is passable, but on-foot exploration and dialogues evoke a broad range of feelings, from pity to loathing. As for voice-acting, well, it’s sure to cause fits of nervous laughter. [Issue#204, p.88]",5
"The First Berserker: Khazan delivers a brutal and versatile combat experience, blending the best elements of the soulslike genre into a fast-paced and intuitive gameplay. While the story lacks originality, the game compensates with its challenging encounters and extensive campaign, offering over 50 hours of engaging content.",8
"The Neo Geo Pocket Selection has been an enjoyable revival of titles that never made it to the mainstream despite their quality. Biomotor Unitron is one such title that I’m sure mecha fans would enjoy. What hurts it the most is that, beyond its repetitive nature and lack of narrative substance, the new package doesn’t actually try to enhance the experience, simply going with the features that every previous Neo Geo Pocket title had on Switch.",7
"The poor controls of Razing Storm's story mode completely negate the chance of getting any enjoyment from it, and they make the rest of the game feel incomplete since the story doesn't get a recap in arcade mode.",7
"F1 2013 is the franchise’s most complete, versatile and thoughtful iteration yet. Fans of the sport will lap up what is an extremely rewarding product. For everyone else, Codemasters’ lone residency atop the podium ensures the upgrade over last year’s game is minimal, especially if you don’t know the difference between Gerhard Berger and the Nurburgring’s fast-food stand.",8
"Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition is a great JRPG, with a well told story, elemental gameplay and a dazzling world to explore. The massive epilogue, the excellent graphic upgrade and the lightening of some mechanics make it a highly recommended game even for those who have already explored the original. If you know how to go beyond some hesitation in the pace and a video resolution not always up to date, you'll have in your hands a great JRPG.",9
"While it may not have Civilization’s country-spanning scale or Total War’s grand battles, it’s nevertheless a satisfyingly deep strategy game. Age of Empires may be ancient by videogame standards but this engaging, challenging overhaul is well worth digging up.",8
"Need for Speed Unbound delivers a controversial ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" style, with cel-shaded characters within a realistically rendered world, but gameplay-wise the beautiful open world of Lakeshore City is somewhat not much interesting to explore.",7
"After hours spent in the world of Age of Empires - Definitive Edition, we still don't have the answer to the real question: why should we play this remake? Gameplay-wise, the genre has seen a lot of improvements over the years, and the developers weren't bold enough to give a fresh start to the original title. At the end of the day, this seems more and more like a wasted opportunity.",7
"Paleo Pines offers a fresh spin on what is starting to feel like an oversaturated genre, yet still maintains the same satisfying day-to-day loop of traditional farming simulators. It’s a lot of fun for dinosaur fanatics, but there’s a lack of content to drive you to keep coming back once you’re set up.",6
"Gripshift usurps Ridge Racer as the PSP's greatest racer. In terms of fun, longevity and value for money, it even beats Mario Kart DS into submission - and that's really saying something!",10
"The storyline and voice acting are the high points, but it's a real shame that all the Evil Dead games have simply focused on mindless combat instead of more substantial adventuring.",6
"Stronghold Crusader 2 was a rare game that I got lost in. I started playing and before I knew it, it was six hours later. Who can resist a game about castle building, economy raising, and taking on large castles full of troops and hazards?. Especially when you can soften up the numbers by launching diseased animals over castle walls.",9
"Seeing as this is an add-on, it's a little much to expect it to have the kind of extra content that a full game would have, but what's here is certainly worth the $30 -- provided you haven't gotten tired of the series yet.",7
"Easy to learn and difficult to master, Fluidity: Spin Cycle may be an eShop exclusive, but it looks and plays like a full-fledged retail release. If you have even the slightest interest in physics-based puzzle games, add this one to your download list ASAP.",8
"Starwhal was built for local multiplayer, and that's where it shines best. Its hilarious flip-and-flop gameplay gets a lot of mileage out of the numerous modes and stages, and the bright neon graphics are delightfully '80s.",8
"Judging by how bizarre some of the fighters are (like a Polish punk rocker who also happens to be a dentist) we're guessing that the guys over at Novarama are definitely on some kind of drug. Which would also explain why the actual fighting is so crappy. [March 2012, p.55]",6
"Throne and Liberty is a full-fledged next-gen RPG thanks to both his impactful visual style as well as an incredibly polished gameplay. The game sets whole new standards for the genre, hence looking like a promising future is ahead. Now it is time to see if Throne and Liberty can truly shine on its own.",9
"Despite some technical glitches, The Big Con succeeds in telling a moving story with plenty of wit and charm. The aesthetics and humour are spot-on, each character brings a new dimension, and this is a world worth getting lost in. If you’re looking for a healthy dose of ‘90s nostalgia and a throwaway attitude to petty crime – give it a go. I swear I’m not having you on. This time.",8
"Those thinking the little blue guy had nothing left are sorely mistaken, as he does serve up a pretty good game of tennis. Fans of either classic Sega or Virtua Tennis will immediately feel comfortable with this title and find more than enough to satisfy them. Others may become bored with the repetitive mini-games.",7
"I enjoyed my time with We Are OFK. Even for a visual novel, the storyline can feel a bit too on the rails at times, but Itsumi, Carter, Luca, and Jey's journey is poignant in its relatability and powerful in its narrative exploration through music. This is best expressed in the interactive music video segments, especially when they allow you to fully lose yourself in the song and respond to the vocals, rhythm, or accompanying visuals in your own way. It's a good opening track for OFK's career, and I can't wait to see what's in store for the virtual group.",7
The genre of MOBA is on the rise and Forge is proof of this – addictive action with great visuals is the right choice for you if you found too many trolls in LoL or DOTA. [Jan 2013],7
"The dynamic fights could have been more challenging but the bosses deliver and in the grand scheme the fighting is just a small part of the complex Darksiders mosaic. If you like exploration, puzzles, secrets, the hunt for the bigger better loot plus the occasional scythe wielding, this year it will probably not get much better than this.",8
"Namco Museum brings back pixel perfect emulation of some classic arcades, such as Galaga, Pac-Man or Splatterhouse. It also includes Pac-Man Vs. four player asymmetric game, but t lacks of extra content and there are too few games available.",7
"Overall this is a big improvement over ""Driv3r""...Now, if only they'd make the next game 100% driving. As it stands, Parallel Lines can't help but come across as a pale imitation of ""GTA: San Andreas.""",7
"It's likely Valhalla Knights will either lead to you pulling out your hair in consternation at its difficulty, or have you convinced you're doing something wrong. It’s a hard-lined dungeon crawler of the strictest caliber, and that's fine for anyone simply looking to fell a couple hundred skeletons or trolls in the most painstaking way possible.",5
"One thing about the game will really piss you off, though, and that's the difficulty. In plain English, the A.I. is freaking brutal, and if you make one mistake in most courses, you may as well restart the race. [June 2003, p.52]",7
"Drawing from such a huge universe of content, Shattered Dimensions does a great job at doing something new for the comic genre. While the normal fights are familiar, the tailored feel of each level to each boss is a nice touch.",8
"If you want to experience something a bit different and something that will genuinely chill you to the bone, take note; you need this game. Eternal Darkness takes adventuring and horror to levels that ""Tomb Raider"" and ""Resident Evil"" will never reach.",10
"The Settlers: New Allies is a solid starting point to reboot the RTS franchise. While its campaign is dull enough to be ignored, the game’s bones are strong enough to support solidly entertaining online play. Despite its issues it has the potential to breathe new life into The Settlers as a franchise, which would be great for all RTS fans.",6
"A decent looking sandbox builder of the Minecraft school whose attempts at storytelling and cinematic loudness do not cover up its slow pace, unintuitive button mapping and contrived hardware mechanics. It does however come at a generous price and is currently the only block builder available on the Wii U.",4
"A momentary year's volume that's gas fumes-driven, and that places reliance in fans' benevolence. A presence of the classical open-wheel cars from the rich F1 history, and the old (same) solid driving pattern are grinding off the edges of your disappointment. Well, only if you do not own the last year's volume though.",6
"There’s just not a lot of “wow” here and it feels like a Vectrex game: it’s the same gameplay as any other on-rails FPS, but you’ve just changed the overlay on the screen to a Western.",7
"South of Midnight feels like a mature fairy tale, thanks to an interesting story and a unique aesthetic. However, its gameplay brings it down due to a repetitive cycle and a lack of variety in objectives.",8
"There are many indie 2D platform games to download and Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit competes in a hard area. It has a lot of identity and good colors, but instead some unfinished aspects. Large and humorous, but not very surprising.",6
The A.I. balancing makes the single player game is too difficult to be fun because players are forced to rely on their distance weapons to avoid confrontation. The multiplayer options are nice and make for some average online matches.,7
"If you loved ""Wii Sports"" (and I mean REALLY loved it,) don’t mind terrible motion controls, and have two or three friends willing to play a few sub-par mini-games, then Summer Sports: Paradise Island may be worth a rental. For most Wii owners, though, it stands as just another in a string of third-party disappointment.",5
"GRIP is a fast game like you have never seen. The game lets you battle friends online and offline in diverse modes. Unfortunately the high speed has its cons, like the many times you'll crash and the total chaos this game embodies.",7
"The problem with Unbounded is that it doesn't seem comfortable sharing its secrets with you. It's called Ridge Racer, it looks like Burnout, and anyone who has played an arcade racer will, not unreasonably, expect a certain handling model...Unbounded is not that game.",8
"All in all, Zombie Driver HD is not a bad game. There is sadly no multiplayer to speak of, which is a missed opportunity in my opinion. Being able to tear up the streets with a friend would have added to the enjoyment. The game does offer enough content for a good time, and the improved HD visuals make the on-screen carnage really pop. If you are a fan of car combat games and killing mindless zombies, I suggest checking this one out.",8
"Lovers of dark fantasy and charming characters should play Last Story without a second thought, but a gamer used to modern-day levels of production value and polish won't easily set those expectations aside.",8
"Better than the original. Too bad it&#146;s not a huge leap over it. It&#146;s still a mediocre card-based RPG, and there are a few annoying gameplay elements whose inclusion leaves me puzzled.",6
"Resistance:Burning Skies offers decent controls and pretty cool weapons. Although that's an accomplishment in itself, the game does nothing further to set itself apart and merely offers a mediocre experience.",6
"If you’re a fan of Neopets, you’ll probably end up wanting to check this out because, well, you’re a fan. However, for the majority of the gaming populace, avoid this game like the plague. There’s no fun to be had here.",2
"The First Berserker: Khazan is a standout title that successfully blends challenging gameplay, stunning visuals, and atmospheric audio to create a compelling experience for fans of the Souls-like genre.",8
"With up to four players racing together, Downhill Domination offers plenty of adrenalin- pumping action and if you are looking for a different and rewarding racer then this is one mountain worth climbing.",8
"Under siege proves, that with a good control scheme, strategy games can be very playable on a console. Where the game misses strategic depth, it redeems itself by calling upon your quick strategic decisions and its high difficulty. The learning curve could've been a bit less steep though.",7
"While not a thoroughly outstanding game, BOXBOY! is an eminently pleasant, breezy little puzzle-platformer that offers some moderate challenge and focuses more on just having a nice time. A fuss-free, no-pressure adventure that takes a plain gimmick and showcases just how versatile it can be.",8
"Ghost Recon 2 completely outdoes the original Ghost Recon in every way possible. Good graphics, amazing sound and sound effects, very fun gameplay but a lacking story and campaign mode.",8
"It's pretty - really, really pretty, with smooth animations, dynamic lighting, and remarkably detailed, solid-looking textures... [But] the story execution falls a bit short. [Feb 2005, p.70]",8
"The interesting characters and the unique gameplay make Ghost Trick a game that can be enjoyed for hours. The search for solutions of puzzles, combined with the many plottwist, give the game a vibe present in the old point-and-click adventures.",8
"We were relieved to discover that FFXIII-2 had much more to offer than its sterile CGI-driven predecessor. Not only are there some great mini-games in the form of time paradox puzzles, there are also plenty of side quests. It goes to show that Square Enix truly listens to its fans. [February 2012, p.84]",9
"Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is a fantastic addition to the Switch's library and one of the best party games on the system. While it has a few technical issues holding it back, it is still well worth your time.",8
"There is an awful lot to like about Those Who Remain, but unfortunately, there is also a lot which will leave players deeply frustrated. Its most fundamental problem is that it tries to do too much. The atmosphere and storytelling, particularly at the start of the game is a great start, but the developers felt the need to add elements of survival horror, which ultimately exacerbate rather than scare.",6
"Pikuniku almost feels like playing through an episode of Adventure Time. The writing is consistently brilliant, and without fail very entertaining. Off-the-wall humour isn’t always successful but when it’s done well it really does bring a world to life. The highlight for me in Pikuniku involved a toaster, which is all I’ll say on the matter. Honestly, it’s just a really fun game and you should play it. It is only a few hours of your time, and it’s sure to bring a smile to your face.",8
"If the steep learning curve has you hollering ""Mayday!"" a little too often, you can always switch sides and play as a Japanese pilot&#151;and plan a little do-it-yourself Pearl Harbor.",6
"Maybe it's the rather lacklustre music, the numerous side-quests that feel more bolted on than they should, or the forehead-slappingly stupid AI of the enemies and your companion, but the whole experience feels decidedly flat at times; not a good sign for a game that's supposed to absorb you into its world. [Jan 2004, p.117]",5
"If you own either of [the console versions], you’d have to be crazy to buy this game for the 360, because all you get for the extra twenty dollars are some disappointingly jaggy graphics.",6
"A wonderful example of how to make a good Smash Bros. send-up. It's not quite as polished as Nintendo's premier fighting franchise, but it is a fun experience with an entertaining and interesting single-player mode, as well as amusing multiplayer, if you can find the people around to play it.",8
"Burning Skies leaves little doubt that the Vita is a comfortable home for first-person shooters, but the platform's first FPS is disappointingly dated. Toothless enemies and simplistic level design make for tepid campaign action, and the solid multiplayer suite is too limited to be a big draw.",6
"Resident Evil Revelations 2 is a necessary step forward for the Resident Evil franchise, with more action-oriented gameplay and a story that works well on its own. Raid mode is amazing, although the lack of online at launch is disappointing.",8
"The game feels more like a proof of concept for something far bigger, rather than a proper VR title in its own right. This lighthouse will always carry a forlorn sense that infinity isn’t quite as infinite as it is meant to feel.",6
Time-shifting in a fascinating environment of a slightly fantasy world makes The Sexy Brutale a detective story for demanding players that they will remember for a long time. [Issue#274],8
"Done before and done better, Rainbow Skies is a game that has taken a fairly bland concept to begin with and proceeded to not change a thing about it. If you're looking for an epic tale of heroes and rogues, you'd be better off looking elsewhere.",4
"In FC 25, FC IQ provides a welcome strategic overhaul for several FC modes, and Rush is apt to be a big hit for FC online community now with more social options. FC 25 is not a largest leap from FC 24, but definitely a step in the right direction for the franchise.",9
"can easily recommend Overclocked, but in doing so I will reiterate that the game will not be for everyone. It is, first and foremost, a game that has a story to tell, and it's this tale that takes precedence over the whole adventure.",8
"Hardcore Resistance fans will no doubt like what Nihilistic have managed to get the Vita to do, but for everyone else this is little more than a competent, hard working game that ticks the right boxes but never really pushes the boat out. The graphics are hit and miss, the sound generally terrible and the controls need some work. But it's not a bad game.",6
"Although I’m a huge fan of shooters, I had to force myself to play Immortal: Unchained. The game clumsily tries to marry two formulas: an action game built around firearms and a soulslike. It does some things right – the atmosphere is intriguing, the dismemberment system works fine, boss encounters are done well and the character development system is solid – but it failed in the most important aspect. Immortal’s cardinal sin is its mediocre gunplay, which makes shooting boring and therefore turns firefights into drudgery. [12/2018, p.54]",6
"Need for Speed: Unbound represents the return of Criterion as a top tier developer. The result is one of the best arcade racing games of the last few years and also, a great Need for Speed experience.",9
"This is the Police 2 is a very interesting game, full of new and compelling ideas but packaged in a badly tested final product bound to infuriate players as much as it will amaze them.",7
"Only the steep difficulty curve may prove a deterrent: later levels especially can induce fits of blind GBA-throwing rage. For those with the grit to play it, Astro Boy: The Omega Factor makes a refreshing alternative to all those meandering wander-em-ups.",9
"In my younger years, a kid who lived up the street, let's call him ""Bad Pete,"" had a bright idea involving some frozen Gobstopper candies and his paintball gun. The giant purple welts that followed were far, FAR more painful than playing this game, but not by much.",4
"The Big Con succeeds when, as its title suggests, you’re working on elaborate con jobs that provide clever puzzle ideas with a lot of open and fun gameplay. While the rest of it is fine, it never feels like the sort of epic cross-country adventure it should be, despite what its stakes would suggest. It still makes for a good adventure with well-done challenges, and that alone may be worth it, but don’t expect a grand score by the end.",7
"The First Berserker: Khazan is a masterclass in action combat, delivering thrilling boss fights, diverse level design, and tight mechanics that rival the genre’s best. While the narrative and side characters falter in depth, the fluid progression, customizable skill trees, and satisfying difficulty curve make this a standout soul-like experience—even for players unfamiliar with the Dungeon Fighter Online universe.",9
"So, just like Keanu Reeves, you may be able to save the world from impeding enemies, but he will not be there to save you when you realize how much time you've wasted playing this lackluster licensed title.",5
"The Expanse: A Telltale Series brings back all the features we've seen before in Telltale games, both the good and the questionable. The transmedia text is great, and the rhizomatic bifurcations look promising, but combat and exploration systems remain shallow and unappealing. For fans of the genre and/or the franchise, a treat. For others, not so much.",8
"Age of Wonders 4 is a very strong entry in the overwhelming miasma that is the turn-based 4X market. It implements fantasy elements naturally rather than giving traditional mechanics a mystical lick of paint, and the sheer depth of customisation options, even without unlocking anything, is to be applauded. With the Pantheon system for unlocking things, it’s an ever-growing and changing experience with a heavy emphasis on player agency.",8
"To forget or not to forget? That is the question. With a more personal venture to its name, Frostwood Interactive attempts to denote itself as a company that inspires people's emotional core. Forgotten Fields isn't the most riveting piece of gaming available—actually playing the game comes with its hurdles. Where its success lies is in the way it communicates and molds its characters, how it attempts to bring them to life and have them identifiable. From this, the game is a modest and simple triumph of earnest self-reflection. As it came to an end, I found myself wanting to try just a little harder in my own life.",7
"Vermintide is actually a worthy successor to Left 4 Dead. If you can find some good friends online, just try the co-op mode and have fun. Just don't try it on your own with the help of the A.I.",8
If you love quirky humor and challenging gameplay then this is a title you'll want to be adding to your game collection. And you can't beat the $20 price – just don't let it fool you into thinking this is less of a game than it really is.,9
"Not knowing what to expect with Filthy Lucre and also having some trouble with the game in the first hour caused me to write this game off when I first fired it up. However, after a little play time it turns out that this game isn’t so filthy at all. Filled with cockney rhyming slang and cheeky chappies, Filthy Lucre could be a nice little distraction from all of these big triple-A games that are currently banging on our doors. However, I still don’t know what a Filthy Lucre is.",7
"The gameplay kept me coming back, making the barely-there story fade into the back of my thoughts. The change in combat options is a welcome addition, I just wish that the story had delivered on the comic legacy of one of Marvel's more enduring heroes.",8
"Though technically not a bad game by any stretch thanks to great art direction, solid gameplay, and several potentially fantastic ideas for the future, A Total War Saga: TROY is still an uneven and disappointingly stagnant entry in the Total War franchise.",6
"A magnificent remastering of one of the finest Legend of Zelda games to date. The visual overhaul, the streamlined features and other improvements make this version an even more enjoyable and accessible experience than the original N64 release.",10
"The frustrating part is it&#146;s out and out lack of a configurable control set up, a feature that would have been so easy to implement, and would have improved this game ten fold.",7
"As a huge fan of the Tropico series, I’m delighted with the package that Tropico 5 Penultimate Edition provides, but I certainly don’t think I would recommend it as highly to someone who had recently invested in Tropico 5 on the Xbox 360, for example.",7
"There is potential here, some moments that show the capability of Vita to present a really good FPS experience, but those moments are undermined by important graphical glicthes, poor AI, bland story and and a too short campaign with basic multiplayer.",6
"It's a nice diversion from the run-of-the-mill military strategy games, and it's different enough that casual fans of strategy games might be lured into the glory of being a firefighter.",9
"If you're the type of cerebral gamer who relishes in attacking enemies from behind to do extra damage, or perhaps placing everyone perfectly for a combo attack, then La Pucelle is just as good as the best entries in the genre.",8
"With a few adjustments and improvements, the Sherlock Holmes formula could become the standard for adventure games of the future, as achieving such gameplay variety is no small feat. Highly recommended to fans of the series and adventure games' fans.",7
"If you’re looking for something a bit different to play this summer and have a Tony Hawk-sized action sports itch you need to scratch, Rollerdrome is absolutely worth checking out.",9
"Like its predecessor, Redeemer shines brightest when played with friends. Lonely players, on the other hand, draw the short straw yet again, and are left with little more than a shallow button masher, though the allure of the license may help ease any gameplay pangs.",6
"This is a video game about flying around heaven, shooting and dashing through demons, flirting with your other neons, gathering cards that happen to double as weapons, and talking to angels that just so happen to be cats with comically large sunglasses. If any of that sounds even slightly interesting to you, you may have found your new obsession.",10
"What Monochroma gets right, however, is tone and gameplay. The puzzle platforming is fun to solve once you get the feel for character movement, there’s a lot of variety in puzzle design, and some very clever level layout ties everything together.",7
"Gorgeous and joyful adventure, a game that makes that warm, fuzzy feeling while you're playing it, Samorost 3 takes you on a surreal intergalactic voyage full to the brim with outlandish landscapes and characters.",8
"Commandos: Origins brings the strength and weaknesses of the original-series to the table. While it suffers from a lack of user-guidance and certain inconsistencies, it also gives players a lot of freedom and creates some really satisfying moments.",8
"The Thaumaturge is a role-playing game that tries to go out of the ordinary with its intriguing plot, well-written dialogues, original characters and successful voiceovers. Travelling to 1905 Warsaw and experiencing the harsh conditions of that period first-hand adds a unique atmosphere to the game. However, the lack of enemy diversity, the weak detective mechanics, the simplicity of the side quests and some technical problems make it difficult to recommend it to those who are not hardcore fans of the genre.",8
"NBA 2K23 leaves us torn: On the one hand, it’s an almost perfect simulation of the sport delivering a high amount of detail and gameplay-value. On the other hand, the experience is heavily harmed by microtransactions and in-game advertisments.",8
"Röki is a lovely game with strong characters and a fun, whimsical story. It shakes up its genres enough to be unique, but doesn't try to fix what isn't broken, and doesn't push itself past what it sets out to accomplish. Environment and creature designs are superb, while their human counterparts (of which there are very few anyway) leave a little more to be desired. It's a game just about anybody can pick up, play, and be immersed in a world they're likely not too familiar with, unless they grew up with the folklore this draws inspiration from. A few graphical glitches crop up here and there, but otherwise this is a solid and a fun adventure filled with puzzles, action, and intrigue.",6
"On the whole, Undercover is the most polished LEGO game I’ve ever played. The humor, while often hokey, works alongside the gameplay in a manner that makes the game charming for its long campaign. LEGO City Undercover isn’t the game to save the Wii U from its recent dearth of games, but it is still a solid, fun romp for anyone who has an affinity for LEGO games.",8
"Valhalla Knights is a struggle to play, learn, and involve yourself in. I think there is an opportunity for crazy RPG players to enjoy themselves, but I also know that the game lacks so much substance that the marriage cannot last for long.",3
"Despite its quirks, Darksiders II really delivers on the breadth of its content, making for a sweeping experience that fans of multiple genres should be happy to explore if willing to look past a couple of hiccups along the way.",8
"Instead of balancing on the line between arcade game and simulation, the game tries and fails to be both, giving the whole package a strange split personality that does nothing to endear you to it.",6
"The First Berserker: Khazan is greatness from nothingness personified. Neople has done what so many have tried to do in the past. If TFB Khazan is not on your map, then, well, you need a new map. From brutal yet manageable combat to fantastic level and monster designs, Khazan aims high and hits every target it finds.",10
"This is what I hope the future of downloadable games will be; top notch AAA production values in the form of small $12-$15 packages. Alan Wake's American Nightmare is an excellent game, which will surely whet the appetite of fans of the original for the sequel.",10
"Forza Horizon 5 is a true masterpiece. The new Mexican setting brings in wonderful landscapes, alongside a majestic implementation of the whole graphic compartment. And the contents offered are no less, with a mountain of modes suitable for both those who prefer the single player experience and those who love co-op or competitive ones. A sumptuous work and a true statement of love to the racing games genre in general.",10
"While the music doesn't offer much, except the six tracks found in the rhythm-guitar playing sessions, it's decent and surprisingly fits the game. It's not ""Final Fantasy"", but what is?",7
"Metal Saga allows you the complete freedom to roam about in your vehicle of choice (bigass tank, dunebuggy, etc), equipped how you choose, with whomever you choose, to pretty much do whatever you want.",7
"Might & Magic Heroes VI seems to be handling its innovations quite nicely. They add fluidity and dynamism to an already very appealing game, the scenario of which perfectly handles the license's richness. Too bad our review version didn't allow us to judge the balancing in multiplayer enough, nor its final polishing (it was quite bugged at the time of this review).",8
"Regardless of its shortcomings, New Super Mario Bros. Wii is easily one of the best titles on the system, and an impressive addition to the series. Saving the princess just got fun again.",9
"War Times struggles along and ultimately becomes a casualty of its own conflicts. The shallow tech tree, paucity of unit types, ineffective pathfinding and tedious gameplay make enjoying it a losing fight.",4
"From its sumptuous decor and macabre mysteries to its tragic, toy-like characters, The Sexy Brutale is a smart, sharp and assured game that is well worth your time. Even if you have to adhere to its usual rules.",8
"Every aspect of the game feels polished and ready to go, whether it's the single-player story, the online multiplayer, the numerous unlockables, or the custom mapmaker. This is one of those rare Jack-of-all-trades that has actually mastered them all.",9
"For 720 Microsoft points ($9), DmC: Devil May Cry - Vergil's Downfall is a short but fun experience that does a good job of extending the main game and serving as a bridge for a possible sequel. The gameplay is a little different, and the weapon selection isn't as varied, but the challenge is just right, especially with its plethora of difficulty levels. While it won't convert those who hated the game or felt lukewarm about it, it's a worthy piece of DLC for everyone else.",8
"This game is cheap, but even cheaper on the mobile phones. It's not really a game about fighting or kung fu. It's all about a cute bunny in a world wherein players are jumping and searching for carrots.",6
"Officers boasts some interesting strategic considerations, including a focus on reconnaissance and realistic supply concerns, which have been lacking in recent RTS games. However, the practically nonexistent multiplayer, the punishing difficulty, the exhaustingly long missions, and a few other annoyances make it a difficult game to recommend.",6
"The game isn’t perfect, with minor issues over the game’s short length and occasionally touchy environment interaction, yet this is an easy game to recommend for anyone who loves Metal Gear and a good hack and slash experience.",8
"With ""Brain Age"" on the market already, which offers not only a large selection of puzzles, but also more variety of compelling content, there simply is nothing that makes Sudoku Gridmaster stand out as a worthwhile purchase.",6
"This beautiful metroidvania roguelite strikes a near-perfect balance between what persists and what is totally randomised each time you die. And when you eventually run all the way from the beginning, through the bosses and to the final encounter in one go, it's not because your character is more powerful, it's because you know the game so intimately from all your previous lives.",9
Kingdom Hearts 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue consists of great new content. It is a great role-playing game and gives us more information about the upcoming Kingdom Hearts 3 game. The new graphics live up to expectations.,8
"Amidst all the generic shooters, Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood is a great relief and offers a surprisingly convincing depiction of the Civil War era, coupled with satisfying gameplay.",8
A two-player co-op mode is a great addition. I played it with a friend of mine last night and I seemed to enjoy it much more than the one-player mode. Any Gauntlet fans are advised to try the co-op mode.,7
"In 2023, it's nice to know that an old formula still works. Taito overloaded the cute-ness on this title. The online mode is a nice touch, and definitely extra points for the Space Invaders crossover. Plus, who can turn down online Puzzle Bobble? Puzzle Bobble fans, this one's for you. PAYOMPA!",8
"Overall, however, the expansion to the game was very well done. It makes it easier to perform some very basic functions in the game such as dealing with your factions, and adds some new game mechanics in.",8
"A loving return to the classic stealth strategy formula with beautiful maps, a smart tactical pause system, and modern visuals, though its steep difficulty curve, design quirks, and lack of optimization may alienate newcomers and frustrate even veterans at times.",7
"Filled with enough fan service to make it an undeniable treat for Spider-maniacs, Shattered Dimensions is a fine game that's a little too uneven and repetitive to be more that the sum of its parts.",7
"If you're a fan of the first four games, .Hack//G.U. Vol. 1: Rebirth should make for an interesting twist on the formula you know and love. If you're not a series fan, then this game won't change your mind.",7
While Time Crisis 4 and Deadstorm Pirates are old rail shooters that deliver enough fun to bring back all those old good light gun memories. It all just needs to stay on the rails.,6
"This could have easily been a great tribute to its SNES predecessor, had it paid any heed to what makes the tedium of an RPG tolerable... and that lies squarely in the saga that this game fails to describe.",4
"If you're a Little Witch Academia fan, you may enjoy it even if for the nostalgia. If not, I'm not too sure you'll enjoy it much. I find it pretty hard to think platform fighter fans would jump into this game and find it fun. It's very aimed at the fans of the anime and I can see that the developers hoped that simple fact would draw in the sales numbers.",6
"Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions lands just shy of being the full package, but it delivers a non-stop action ride with something new around every corner. Though its story leaves something to be desired, it's one of the best Spider-Man titles in recent memory, if not the best Spider-Man title to date.",8
"The variety of missions is helpful, but stealth missions become increasingly maddening, and when you're trying to ""save"" someone, it ends up being more of a daunting task than you expected.",4
"A bold new direction for the series, one that slightly remembers the drifting fundamentals while throwing in all sorts of new rules and tricks to liven things up. It's a lot of fun to play online and off, and the presentation really guns it in all directions.",9
"It isn't often that you play something that is so pure and unapologetically itself, but that's Wattam. I don't know if I'll ever play another game that makes me turn all of my friends into fruit so I can progress. It oozes passion, and it has an infectious enthusiasm that's present in each and every aspect of it. Wattam never takes itself too seriously, and that makes it easy to buy into its world and suspend your disbelief. While the gameplay is all over the place, Wattam is held together by themes of friendship and a cohesive soundtrack that actually leave you grinning long after you're done.",7
An atmospheric journey into Scandinavian fairy tales with loads of interesting puzzles. If only the story about the siblings Lars and Tove would have been giving more space to flourish...,8
"Rocksteady and Batman is a combination we'll sorely miss. Their trilogy ends on a high though, with a refinement of their excellent Freeflow combat and Predator modes. The Batmobile is a somewhat mixed experience, but its heart is in the right place. Our much-awaited tour of the city of Gotham was a gorgeous sight to behold and an unforgettable goodbye.",9
"But this is undoubtedly a great start, despite a below average sprinkling of gameplay bottlenecks. It translates remarkably well as an adventure game, but isn’t completely hogtied by adventure game conventions. Bring on episode 2.",7
"It won’t blow the minds of anyone expecting a true NASCAR or Mario Kart experience. But if you enjoy the latter and want a fun clone of that franchise, NASCAR Kart Racing is one of the best made for Wii.",7
"Ultimately, this series is going to have to evolve into a more accessible, playable, solo-friendly experience if it ever wants to be known as anything other than a niche curiosity.",6
"If you liked Immortals, this is basically the same game again, but shorter and with Chinese myths. It’s a shame that a different studio couldn’t, for whatever reason, make its DLC distinct from the base game, but if you want to experience a little bit more of Immortals Fenyx Rising, Myths of the Eastern Realm has you covered. It’s a disappointment, but it’s not a disaster.",6
"Nintendo still knows how to make a damn good Mario game. NSMBW is leaps and bounds over the original DS title, and certainly holds it own against the masterpieces from the days of yore.",9
"Transformers: Fall of Cybertron is a lot of fun, even if its looks aren't on par with its gameplay. It does, however perfectly capture the essence of Transformers and is worth checking out whether you're a life-long Transformers fan or just watched it when you were little and never gave another thought.",8
"The Thaumaturge excels in narrative depth, character development, and atmosphere, offering a captivating experience despite its gameplay limitations. While its investigative mechanics feel lacking and combat could be more diverse, its compelling story, well-crafted characters, and impactful decision-making make it a standout adventure with a unique setting.",8
"Final Fantasy XIII-2 proves itself the better game, but it lacks the same focused storytelling employed in the original. It benefits from an improved battle system, open environments, and an overall level of polish that deserves a nod of respect.",8
"If you ever wished you could play a necromancer, battle dragons and date a Khajiit, or, why not, all three, Elsweyr delivers on that and then some. Just don't give up because of the flavorless storyline.",8
"Sadly, the combat doesn’t have enough depth to trouble the genre’s best (it certainly can’t touch Ninja Theory’s DmC reboot), and there’s a disappointing disposability about the whole experience. This is a project that has been rightfully and respectably salvaged, but one that can’t quite cut it at the top.",7
"Technically, the game could be classed as above-average, but no matter how many times you make use of the more-than-adequate control system and your far-too-limited selection of moves to grind your opponent down, they always seem to pop back up and have the amazing ability to pin you without really doing any work beforehand.",7
"Simply a delightful game to play. With its rich, lively combat system and entertaining characters, it strikes a masterful balance between engaging gameplay and heartfelt story-telling.",9
"Darksiders II might be a long journey, but it is one that is enjoyable the whole way through. Developers Vigil Games have built upon the core established by its predecessor in some intelligent ways, sculpting one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences of the year so far. While some slight technical glitches and control issues mar what would otherwise be an incredible title, Darksiders II is a true delight and a game well worth playing.",8
"With Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood, Techland delivered us an experience worthy of the best Sergio Leone movies: one on one duels and saloon brawls recall to our memory some of the best movies ever seen. A solid story coupled with excellent visuals make the game very enjoying, while on the cons side we find some difficulty spikes that make some scenes quite frustrating.",9
Concord is a game that came out eight years too late and as a result is visibly lagging behind its competition in every way. This game makes sense to buy only if you are bored of every other hero shooter game and you have excess money in your pocket that you urgently need to get rid of.,5
"Devil's Daughter focuses more on story, with a larger plot taking over from the case work in satisfying ways. Some extended sequences of button mashing can become tiresome and the moral choice system doesn't add anything substantial, but the overall experience is great fun.",7
"As for the overall environments themselves, they definitely had some great ideas, but in the end they just don't seem to have the oomph to push you over the edge and be wowed by them.",6
"Actually playing Trek to Yomi is not as much fun as just looking at it. Combat turns the game's 3D world into 2D, forcing you to fight on a single axis. You can move left or right, rotate to collide with enemies, attack or block, and that's pretty much it. Those expecting a super-difficult task might be disappointed, but with the developers going down the path of getting attention rather than creating a new Sifu and Devolver Digital doing the publishing duties, it's certainly going to be an interesting project nonetheless. I think Wild Flying Hog has done an excellent job of helping the player go from a beginner swordsman to an experienced samurai.",8
"The default game mode of Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move is little more than a Nintendo-themed reskin of the 25-year-old Pipe Mania, and frustrates with its randomness. The much better Puzzle Palace and Many Mini Mayhem modes, thankfully, leave us with a good game overall.",7
"Tape 1 of Lost Records: Bloom & Rage is a solid prologue for what might hopefully ""bloom"" into a memorable story of reunion and reconnecting after decades apart. There are some bold new steps for the genre here, that are unfortunately held back by design choices that already felt archaic back when we first encountered them a decade ago. For now, I'm intrigued and interested to see what comes next, despite the obligatory wait.",8
"A magical, meditative experience that blends a surrealist painterly art style with majestic choral music and an imaginative narrative delivery, Sunlight is quite a special game. It won’t be for everyone but if you’re looking for a 30 minute diversion from the trials and tribulations of modern day life, Sunlight is a fantastic diversion.",9
"This game is low budget, sure, but that doesn’t hold it back in the slightest. It’s a very good card game, especially attractive for Eastern European players due to the captivating way in which it deals with Slavic mythology.",7
"Admittedly, there's little here to quicken the pulse, and some of later objectives are troublingly fiddly, with sensitive motion controls and increasingly intricate level design proving uncomfortable bedfellows. But otherwise this is an unusually clever, polished and robust eShop release that offers several hours' worth of dizzy delights.",6
"Electronic Symphony's best new feature is the ability to sort your favorite tunes into a specified order and play them straight through. Or you can have your favorite song run on an endless loop and relive that moment of pure ecstasy, where it's just you and the music.",9
"Nickelodeon Kart Racers 3: Slime Speedway is a perfectly competent kart racer, which is elevated by an insane number of levels, characters, and configuration options. Far better than I expected, Nickelodeon Kart Racers 3 blasts players in the face with a slime-hose of options and game modes, offering hours of entertainment to kids and parents alike. Bottom line is, my kids like it, I like it, and we aren't going to stop playing it any time soon. I can't think of a better recommendation for a title of this nature.",8
"Quarrel does have some odd quirks, such as claiming words like ""Monday"" don't exist while accepting more obscure words. But for logophiles, its mix of strategy and vocabulary is a true pleasure.",8
Traditional strategic and war gamers alike will be in heaven with the wealth of features to tweak and manage as you carve out your destiny in the real world-based computer simulation.,7
"GripShift is a portable game designed to near perfection, it's Super Monkey Ball crossed with Geoff Crammond's legendary Stunt Car Racer; a unique concept that fully utilises its format, resulting in one of the most frustratingly addictive titles on the PSP to date.",8
"Episode 2 is a short, disappointing excursion into what's shaping up to be an arduous five-episode series. I can't decide if Episode 2 is worse than Episode 1, or if the formula is wearing on me already.",6
"This is the sort of smart, focused resurrection of old games I want more of, something that feels old and new with every expedition step. I managed to put more than 40 hours into this quote-unquote small game.",8
"Mr. Miyagi is back… but he shouldn't have left the set of Karate Kid. Reality Fighters may have an interesting concept, but the quality never left the drawing board. This incredibly boring game fails in almost every way. Do not under any circumstances buy it.",4
"Arma 3 is equally a great military simulation, and finally a game. It has its flaws, but when you look at the game's enormous size, they are tolerable. You won't find a better ""trooper simulation"", nor a bigger sandbox playground anywhere.",8
"It doesn’t have a tidal wave of fans supporting it, and it isn’t free to try out or available with any subscription service, so it has a lot of work to do in order to make the effort of playing it worthwhile. Whether that be through trial periods, new modes not before seen in the genre, or even a boost from Secret Level when it airs months from now, but as a middle-of-the-road hero shooter, it can’t rely on any one of these things alone. Concord is good, but it’s not in a good place, and there’s a lot of work that needs to be done to not only keep it afloat, but to get the motor running.",6
"Samurai Warriors 4: Empires is another solid spin-off, but veteran fans may feel a little let down by some of its streamlined gameplay. However, its dynamic nature is usually enough to make up for its lack of depth.",7
"While it isn’t perfect and there are limitations evident in each episode, Life Is Strange sets a new precedent for episodic gaming and reiterates why it’s a bona fide contender for 2015’s GOTY, despite facing fierce competition for that distinguished accolade.",9
Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is a solid celebration for the 20th anniversary of the series’ inception. It caters to fans who have stuck around to see the next big thing and does so in a complete package with new surprises and things to come.,8
"Some people are going to hate it on sight, but I believe that like SaGa Frontier before it, Romancing SaGa has a welcome place in the gaming library of anyone who appreciates a completely free-roaming experience and isn't above being patient with the quirks of gameplay it holds.",8
"Every aspect of the game could stand to be improved a little: economic system is superfluous, leveling is hard at the beginning and much easier towards the end, and it’s always weird to take a castle with just a bunch of soldiers. But the atmosphere trumps everything. After all, it’s been a long time since anyone tried to make an RPG in at least quasi-historical setting. [Sept 2015, p.66]",7
"Despite it's poor pacing during the second act and its less than satisfying end, Final Fantasy XIII-2 can hold its head up high as a large improvement over its predecessor in the places where it counts.",9
"Metroid Prime Pinball may be the surprise sleeper of the fall, and although the ""Prime"" moniker may be out of place, it certainly embodies the fun and sense of addiction that other Metroid titles have shown.",9
"So who is this game for? I can imagine cosy gamers being delighted by the intricacies of the puzzles as I was, but others might feel this interrupts the simplicity. I can also see how a game like this could spark delight and long-term nostalgia for someone before finding games that incorporate its elements a bit better. Maybe escapism shouldn’t be the marker for a successful cosy game. Maybe it was necessary for me to play something so casually at the end of the year, so that my mind could be freed up to contemplate the wins and losses of 2024, and the resolutions to be attempted in 2025. Critter Café, with its flaws and subtle successes, is at least a fittingly weird game for the end of a pretty weird year.",6
"Although I have a few gripes with the game, my overall time with Fallen Legion was a pleasant one - the developer did an excellent job with their first game on consoles. While it lacks a bit of polish and is quite rough around the edges, it makes up for it by providing a great experience that doesn't overstay its welcome. I found that many of these issues could be fixed in their next attempt, and I am looking forward to it.",7
"Lushfoil Photography Sim succeeds in its approachability and how it garners intrigue. It gracefully connects the world of photography and creative curiosity, naturally on display in gaming.",10
"Although enjoyable overall, the flaws in aspects like exploration or level design take their toll on this adventure. It does have some virtues, but there are better alternatives available.",7
Better than last year's game but only because of the innovative use of the trick stick on offense and defense. A few hiccups such as the unavoidable juke animations hurt the experience a bit but it's still fun while it lasts.,7
"Part Time UFO is an interesting new approach to the puzzles games by HAL Laboratory. Particularly fun when played in coop, it's charming, humorous and a good choice if you like this kind of games.",8
"Although Time Crisis 4 and Razing Storm are fun on their own, Deadstorm Pirates and the Move compatibility pushes this collection out of ""pass"" territory and into a firm ""rent or buy on the cheap"" recommendation.",6
"Essentially a multimedia encyclopedia with a few playable levels thrown in, Covert Ops Essentials is mainly for ""Rogue Spear"" fanatics and those with a passing interesting in counterterrorism.",7
"Though it’s iterative in a lot of ways, Forza Horizon 5 is a near-faultless open-world racing experience that’s so sure of itself and its offerings that it goes the extra mile to sprinkle in the kinds of fan service that people go wild for. As a game it’s tremendous, but it’s also a brilliant, interactive postcard for a culture that is passionate about few things more than their country and their cars.",10
"With a well-written but quite complex story and its simplistic and sometimes frustrating gameplay, Fallen Legion feels like it doesn't know where to stand. Even though it's far from perfect, this game that allow us to experience two different stories on PS4 and PS Vita can definitely entertain you if you're not too demanding.",6
"It will be nearly impossible to evaluate Final Fantasy VII Rebirth outside of the trilogy as a whole in the years to come. But right now nothing is stopping us from doing so. To put it succinctly, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is one of the finest games in Square Enix's entire history.",10
"Dark Sector is constantly impressive and tighter than most triple-A releases, with only a few tiny niggles and its decidedly basic structure holding it back from taming the genre altogether.",8
"The environments are lush and lively; I'll never forget leaning against a tree and being startled by a tarantula crawling across the bark an inch away, or the time I had my rifle poked over a boulder in a tense standoff, and a butterfly landed right in front of my face, only to fly away when my opponent shot at me.",8
"Although it's a 'member' of a not particularly popular genre, Lumines is without any doubt one of the best PlayStation Vita launch games, a visual/audio gem with a high quality production value.",9
"Splatoon 2 manages to deliver an addictive and engaging online multiplayer experience with plenty of ways to keep you busy and layers of satisfying combat to keep you coming back. The lack of social features is a significant flaw, but it isn't a fatal one, and hopefully we'll see that aspect of the game improved in the near future.",8
"When The Waylanders succeeds, the game is one of the most solid experiences I’ve had all year. But those successes are few and far between, while the rest of the title fails to keep itself afloat among a sea of bugs and poorly thought out gameplay decisions.",3
"Gamers should find that Tropico 3 is one of the better city-building RTS games to come out in a while, and although it may not be much different from its predecessors and its online ""features"" don't amount to more than social media ""lite,"" what it does offer is simply solid and polished gameplay.",8
"Delivers a rush like few racing games or action sports games have ever achieved. The game's new, open-ended structure, excellent audio, enhanced trick system, and improved graphics combine to make this a superlative sequel to a series that's always had high standards.",9
"Side Order is an entertaining change to the more typical Splatoon style, encouraging different ways to play and to embrace variety. Hardcore Splatoon players will likely still make mincemeat (or is that chum) of the Spire. It will offer a tougher challenge for more general players, and to see the game properly through you’ll be making a bunch of attempts at the Spire. If you want more Splatoon in your life then you either have this or should get the Splatoon 3 Expansion Pass, especially if you want something more outside of the online/multiplayer side of the game.",8
"Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move is a really ""by the book"" puzzle game, and the book is a good one, indeed. The editor adds to an already notable longevity, and, while it probably lacks that little thing that creates a masterpiece, it remains an excellent purchase on the eShop.",8
"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth evoked all kinds of emotions in me, made me see my low-poly childhood friends as real people, and allowed me to once again be part of a grandiose, fate-challenging, god-defying adventure that I haven't experienced since the PS1 days.",10
"It's a shame the developers spent more time on the presentation of their game than on the actual gameplay. Out of the seven mini-games on offer here, we can only recommend two. And those are half-hearted recommendations.",4
"While its predecessor may have made for a decent Xbox launch title, Fuzion Frenzy 2 is really an unremarkable party game for this day in age, with numerous problems on top of it all.",6
"Simply put, LEGO City Undercover is a blast to play. It's funny, challenging, and features tons of extra content that'll keep you busy for hours. Sure, it's got a few minor quibbles here and there but it's hard to dwell on them when everything else is so enjoyable.",9
"There's a new big case to solve in Baker Street, with so many puzzles but a lot of boring action sequences. A missed opportunity to create the best Sherlock Holmes game, despite the open world feature.",7
"I'm sure Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown will eventually get itself together and grow with new features and content. Hopefully, it can overcome its server problems before they drive away its player community. Personally, I want to stay, but this town is making it really hard to.",7
"The epic world of The Dark Eye arrives ten years later to our PC. Based on a board RPG game, Drakensang features some interesting ideas that bring back to life some of the best moments of the classic. Featuring ideas from Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights franchise, the game packs a good set of rules with good-looking graphics and nice sound. At the end, it doesn't get to be a high budget production, but still gives the player great moments and great value that is worth the money.",8
"In fairness to games out there that are sequels, and actually bring something new to the table, to call this game a sequel is to do those other games an injustice. Champions: Return to Arms is an expansion pack, if anything.",8
"It is still an enjoyable experience where you can build your own frontier with a relatively easy system. However, the entire process to win the game is too long and boring to aim for a shift to a competitive RTS. It is not easy to motivate the frontier exploring since pretty much all activities are for just military buildup.",6
"One of the most enjoyable, and addictive, games I've played in years. Never have I expected so little from a game and gotten so much. I truly relished every (split) second of it, not only as a great racing game but as a great videogame that happens to be about racing.",9
"Hellbound is a great experience. Although it does rely heavily on the DOOM aesthetic, Saibot Studios have created a core gameplay experience that could be the launchpad of something brilliant.",8
"Suda-written games have a lot of author appeal in them; the wrestling fandom (he used to write story modes for Fire Pro Wrestling games), violence, and language are definitely Grasshopper trademarks. The Silver Case 2425 puts it into a unique package, and it’s worth digging into if you’re already predisposed to digging into some good mysteries. Just maybe play with headphones and not in front of younger people.",8
"Nintendo reinvents Majora's Mask again with this amazing remake on the 3DS. The game is a lot faster and easier to play, without sacrificing the difficulty or the great setting. If you are a Zelda fan, you can't afford to miss this strange entry.",9
"The great thing about Ultimate Brain Games is that there is enough variety here for all interests. Even if you're not convinced you would make a good chess player, it's always there should you want to take a stab at it.",8
"As a package, NBA 2K23 is a phenomenal celebration of basketball. The return of the Jordan Challenge retells a stellar career and features exemplary presentation. NBA Eras takes you through an abundance of classic content and the on-court action feels tight and polished. MyCareer is substantial but still can't shake the intrusiveness of microtransactions. It delivers a decent story but can feel like a grind. Even with these problems, the sheer wealth of modes makes NBA 2K23 worthwhile.",8
"In many ways, it's Fallout 76's initial foundation that so severely holds it back from its most engaging content to date. Wastelanders is a clear return to more traditional and captivating Fallout stories, with characters and quests that give you room to role-play in a way the original quests lacked. But they still require you to dedicate a lot of time to survival mechanics that don't reward your effort, and its frequent combat remains monotonous and uninteresting. Wastelanders introduces some of the best Fallout sequences in recent years, but you'll have to dig through a lot of Fallout 76's enduring issues to experience them.",8
"Naruto: Ninja Council 2 isn't an awful game, but it doesn't do anything particularly well, either. It's strictly for the most die-hard fans of the show, and even they may find themselves growing bored with the game after a while.",4
"Wuppo is the kind of game you kinda want to remove from your memory, just to be able to play it again, and enjoy it like the first time. Despite its childish graphics and some gameplay flaws, Wuppo is a truly entertaining, light-hearted experience.",8
"Shadows: Awakening provides an excellent starting point for players new to the Heretic Kingdoms saga. Rich dialogue, ambiance and lore give life to the unique parallel system. Being able to swap between the Shadow realm and the mortal world unlocks new possibilities within the game and makes for an excellent concept. A lack of gameplay balance and other technical issues keep Shadows: Awakening from reaching its full potential. It can be said that this is a case of an excellent concept suffering from a less-than-excellent execution. Fans of the isometric RPG genre may still find the title enjoyable for what it is, as it creates a streamlined RPG experience with ample content to enjoy.",7
"This is the first time since the original that the series has been so accessible. With the full 3D engine and freedom of movement, Myst V is more fun and fast-paced than you can reasonably expect an adventure game to be, and is just as visually stunning as its predecessors.",8
"The Sojourn is based on an interesting concept, although the game has some narrative limitations. The puzzles are nice and pleasant to solve, but in some phases a greater level of challenge would have been better.",8
"There is a very specific person who will find this game utterly compelling and won’t be able to put it down. This tale of industrialisation colliding with culture and superstition in pre-WW1 Poland has every confidence in itself and begs for your curiosity as you get to know the mysterious Wiktor Szulski and his hunt for emotion-hungry demons. This game is an immediate, though flawed, all-timer and belongs in the Polish canon of interactive literature for generations to come.",8
"The best part of the game is definitely the atmospheric elements and the ""straight out of the movie/series"" aspect. The gameplay itself is ok, but is not groundbreaking by any means.",8
"There's more humor and character development at the Web site than in the game, so if you are still curious, check out the Death Jr. Web site and maybe - maybe - rent it for a day or two.",7
"For those starved action gamers in need of an immediately accessible fix, there is still some strange sense of joy to be found in pointlessly gunning down the minions of evil in colorful environments.",5
"Clash: Artifacts of Chaos is an interesting mix of ideas, most of them familiar, with some unique twists. The hand-to-hand combat focus is good, although it takes a lot of experimentation to do everything right. The world is intriguing and surprising, especially when it comes to character and enemy design. This is a hard game and any sentient enemy can become a big problem fast. But the biggest issue with the game is how confusing it can be to move through the world, especially when doubling back through already known areas. Clash: Artifacts of Chaos rewards patience and quick reflexes and shows how being extra weird can make a game memorable.",8
"There's something about Bohemia's world-building that inspires people. Importantly though, Arma 3's vanilla content now stands on equal footing with those third-party inspirations. It's still a little rough around the edges, but it's a darned impressive package nonetheless.",8
"Need for Speed Unbound could have been one of the best entries in the legendary series. It has great visuals, an good soundtrack and a lot of collectibles, but fails to deliver a better racing experience. The progression system is a mess and there are more police chases than actual races.",7
"How detailed is this title? Well, suffice it to say that it has received FAA approval to be used as a training tool for pilots aiming for commercial certification, instrument rating and airline transport pilot certification...This is not a game for the casual flight sim fan. This title will require a lot of thought, and a lot of effort. For the more serious fan of the genre, this might provide the depth, variety and challenge you are looking for.",7
"Cute and charming in a macabre way. The opportunity for reaping rewards from the creative premise is, however, largely squandered. The control problems are almost enough to sound the death knell by themselves, and other issues of balance or polish also interfere with player enjoyment.",6
"The graphics are cheery and hilarious, with the Rabbids stealing the show from Rayman. The Wi-Fi Connection function is a nice touch, though it lacks online multiplayer. Invite these Rabbids to your next holiday party.",8
Sherlock Holmes: The Devils Daughter is another step closer to a really good Holmes game. It's a really enjoyable game with a lot of improvements. Still the graphics are not up to date and the voice acting is really not good.,6
Call of Juarez Bound in Blood has one of the best Western FPS games period with one of the grittiest story lines this side of a Clint Eastwood movie. With its solid graphics and audio mixed with the outstanding gameplay this is one of the best action games for the hot summer nights.,9
"It's a little too short on long term appeal, and overpriced too but playing a lunatic science geek hell bent on bringing the world to its knees is always fun so some arcade fans may find a fair bit of enjoyment here.",5
"Comes up short in a number of ways. Would you really notice a big difference between playing the last game again on a higher difficulty and running through the new one with your eyes half-closed? That's the $50 question, and it's one that unfortunately must be answered in the negative.",7
"NBA 2K23 is one of the best entry in the series so far, thanks to its devout tribute to the story of the sport and a few gameplay innovations. ERA MyNBA e the Jordan Challanges represent the best example of sport digital storyitelling in the world of videogames, while MyTeam and MyCareer suffer from the usual monetization policy, even if The City is far more engaging than the last year. On the court NBA 2K23 is a solid basketball experience, with a new shooting system that feels simple and consistent.",8
"In the end, Fight’N Rage can’t escape its short run-time which is prominent with every Beat ‘Em Up game (they were originally created to serve as short Arcade experiences, after all), but the branching story paths, combo-heavy characters and numerous unlockable extras more than make up a full package filled with incentives to keep playing. As a modern throwback to Arcade classics, Fight ‘N Rage is one of the very best in the business right now.",8
"It's not the deepest action title that you've played, but X-Men Origins: Wolverine does a fantastic job of recreating the conflicted beast that is one of Marvel Comics most enduring characters.",8
"The detail of the environments, the splendour of the graphics, the wonder of the physics engine, all these things combine with the dangerously entertaining gameplay to make SHOWW2 the best game of its kind, and one of the most refreshingly enjoyable games I have had the pleasure to review.",9
"It challenges you, it gives you room to breathe, but also a purpose and of course it´s fun for every minute of it, which is all that counts in the end. You don´t have to invent everything again to get that. Not, if you have mastered the craft like Vigil Games obviously has.",10
"For those seeking an authentic simulation, NBA 2K23 delivers. For those who couldn’t be bothered to invest into either MyTeam or MyCareer, you will find plenty else to occupy your time. At the end of the day, it’s all about what you’re willing to check at the door. There will always be things players take or leave. On the whole, it very much feels like a big step in the right direction. Underneath, I continue to let myself imagine ‘What if…’ which is why personally, it’s difficult to look past the ever-present elephant in the room.",7
"If anyone but Digital Eclipse had worked on this title, it could have ended in disaster. It was definitely worth the three-year wait to get a quality Grand Theft Auto title on a Nintendo handheld.",8
"Goes back to those simpler times of morally questionable, top-down gameplay, but a lame story, shoddy control, and uncooperative camera derail any standards that its brethren have set.",6
"No matter how hard you search, there's little here that wasn't done by StarCraft, Age of Empires or any other recent RTS... There's no worthy inovation here to raise this above any other title. [Jan 2005, p.114]",5
"Guarantees at least a few hours of intensive intellectual training and a substantial exam for special awareness and imagination. If you miss the likes of The Witness and The Talos Principle, definitely put it on your wishlist. [12/2019, p.52]",8
"What Ultimate Ride does, it does pretty well. The problem is that it does so very, very little. And with an entrance fee of $40, there should be much, much more: people in foam rubber animal costumes, women flashing their breasts on the log ride, kids barfing during the loops, etc.",2
"A beautiful and capable 4X game, with memorable personality that's seemingly calculated down to the pixel level. It doesn't deviate much from the genre's norms, but it delivers a generally satisfying 4X experience with only a few missteps in combat and diplomacy. Provided you're also okay with tackling a steep learning curve, it's also a satisfying entry point for the genre.",8
"Samorost 3 is the kind of game that I’d recommend to parents looking for something to play with their young children, or to anyone with a whimsical disposition. It is as transporting as a richly-dyed scarf wafting through the air.",8
"While it makes the games a cakewalk for Mega Man veterans, it allows you to appreciate Zero 1-4 as pure action games. That the collection allows us to revisit the series free of its excesses makes it well worth your time.",6
"Californium is a video game UFO. A very good game about sci-fi and Philip K. Dick life. It's a strange experience with lot of psychedelia. When you play it, you just want one thing: to open a k.Dick book.",7
"The Thaumaturge is a well-written narrative adventure with an excellent setting. Its mechanics, borrowed from RPGs, are not overly complex, but contribute to the quality of the experience.",8
"New Allies fails in breathing new life in The Settlers' franchise: the crossover between the classic gameplay and the RTS mechanics feels dull and rushed, leaving the player with the feeling that this is not The Settlers' return they longingly waited for.",6
"For the price of $29.99, Super Collapse 3 is a decent game. Sure, I have encountered better puzzles as of late (Puzzle Quest), but Super Collapse 3 delivers enough satisfaction for the price of entry.",7
"Ikachan is a marvelous introduction to a much larger, more ambitious game. But that's all it is: an introduction. If you are willing to accept that, you'll happily enjoy the short time you spend in its watery world.",6
"SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE is an engaging, albeit shallow experience. The combat is outstanding and still one of the best you can experience, only enhanced by the new abilities featured in this standalone. However, where the combat has improved, the taut and well-thought-out nature of the levels is lost due to the roguelike nature of the game, with the thought and surprise of the originals story lost in what is mostly meandering waffle here. Is it a good game? Yes, it's well worth playing if you just want the combat. If you want more, you'll likely be disappointed.",6
"Constantine's narrative is compelling enough, and some excellent puzzles save it from the ignominy of being yet another average third-person movie tie-in, but only just... Yes it's uncomplicated, but still an engaging realisation of the source material. [Apr 2005, p.99]",5
"I had to ask the game's publisher for detailed instructions on navigating the game just to make it part of the way through the first mission, and I still lost half my men in a half-hour. Those who complain that video games have become too easy will welcome Soldiers, but the rest of us will flee in terror.",6
MotoGP 13 is a good simulation ruined by poor graphics and few issues with the overall rhythm of its Career mode. Milestone has done a good job in recreating the vehicles' physics but the developers should try to improve their techniques.,7
"Despite these niggles, Yonder is obviously a fantastic game for adults to play with their children, and for slightly older children to be allowed to play unsupervised. Even for adults it's surprisingly beautiful, and a soothing breath of anxiety-calming non-violence. But the older you get, the less mileage you might receive from Gemea.",7
"Despite its frustrating enemy AI and the limitations of your arsenal, Call of Juarez has plenty of pistol packin’ heat for the average buckaroo, with a decent, profanity-laced storyline and a bevy of unique multiplayer modes.",7
"Even when accounting for slight hiccups, such as odd audio balancing in Door to Phantomile, there are no significant obstructions to enjoyability present here. Performance on PlayStation 5 was also smooth, if that was a concern. I’m eager to see this highly-anticipated duology sell well, so Klonoa can potentially become a new fixture in the platforming pantheon.",10
"While Aporia may not be for everyone, those hardcore Myst enthusiasts will find a lot to like. It’s got the bare bones of a decent puzzle/exploration game, and it’s got atmosphere for miles. The controls, the graphics, and the level design effectively transport the player to a desolate world. It’s beautiful and enchanting. If only there was something more to do there.",6
"Monaco fails at balancing fun and cold math; the first levels are so easy that you’ll run through them without even thinking, but by the end the awkward arcade shenanigans will become the downfall of your carefully laid plans.",7
It is not an epic strategy game like Dune but this little gem offers something for almost everybody: Beginners will not be overburdened while experienced players will get a challenge with the unusual mechanics and veterans can ramp up the difficulty level to get their money's worth.,8
"Tropico 3 beats the hell out of history books, and strangely, most games of its kind. I only wish that the soundtrack had more tunes. And that I could have the DJ shot. God, I can't stand that guy.",8
"Neon White stands out for its gameplay that allows you to enjoy hyper speed action with simple maneuver. Even though who are not familiar with speedruns can enjoy it without burden, obtaining ace medals is challenging enough for skilled gamer as well. Meanwhile, a bit awkward Korean localization makes it difficult to fully immerse into characters.",8
"Has fun, straightforward gameplay and a simple heart. There is a little more to it, like plenty of game-time extending side quests, but some of the extras just seem like coronary blockage.",6
"Your adoration for Bonkies will really depend on what you're looking for. If you're after an easy to pick up party game for all the family, then Bonkies is not the chimp 'em up for you. However, if you're after a demanding co-op experience that requires both solid teamwork and communication to achieve your goals then Bonkies is absolutely top banana.",8
"It’s always a difficult task to raise the bar on something that’s already top notch, and when it comes to the racing games, due to the natural limits of the genre, the task gets even harder. But thanks to the now more mature than ever PlayGround studio, Forza Horizon 5 crushes its own bar and reaches a whole new level, easily becoming one of the best and most complete racing games of all time, if not THE best.",10
"After a long string of epic disappointments, it's nice to enjoy a Spider-Man game so much that I'm actually looking forward to replaying the missions with new abilities and new costumes. Even if you've been burned on lackluster Spider-Man titles before, don't miss this game – Shattered Dimensions simply isn't the one to skip.",9
"How to Train Your Dragon plays like it has the potential to be a great family game as well as one of the better movie tie-ins releasing this year, especially for the fantasy-driven children in your family.",8
"Fast-paced, challenging, and visually pleasing, Rollerdrome is a game that deserves all the praise heaped upon it. Strap on your skates and load up those pistols, it’s time to dive into this brilliant skater-shooter.",9
"Dead Cells is one of the best rogue-vania games I’ve ever played. The visuals are to die for and it runs beautifully (docked and handheld), but the best facet is that the combat is ultra responsive.",10
The online play is the smoothest of any fighting game ever to have an online option. Players will be able to play with out the constant lag as found in the few other online fighting games.,8
"The difficulty alone will put many off, while others won't care for the dark humor and cynical world view that ooze from this game. Those who do, though, will find their willingness to take a chance rewarded by a quirky but ultimately satisfying action adventure.",8
"As battle royale efforts go, Bloodhunt is surprising; which is more than other like-minded efforts can lay claim to. Though cross play remains unbalanced against more capable PC players and concerns over balancing and map variety remain, Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodhunt nonetheless brings a scintillating blend of furious traversal, inspired PvE design and neat lore from the World of Darkness setting to fashion one of the most refreshing battle royale efforts in quite some time.",8
"The best thing about Fuzion Frenzy 2 is that it’s an easy 1,000 achievement points (there are only 16 different tasks, and most of those are to play through a tournament with each player).",4
"After Us succeeds in what it sets out to do. The world that Gaia is trying to save may be a grave warning to us all, but After Us never feels heavy or oppressive. Your platforming efforts are rewarded by reassurances that maybe everything isn’t doomed after all. Gameplay is perfectly synced with the narrative to create an experience that is both enlightening, interesting, and - despite the doom and gloom - enjoyable. It is a game that makes you feel like you’re making a difference all while reminding you just how to do so in the real world. After Us seeks to better players, not just entertain them. To put it simply, it’s impactful and a must-play.",8
"Its story and themes are delivered well, but they don't come off as pretentious or preachy. The challenging boss battles deliver immense satisfaction, and the breaks of tranquil exploration offer delightful moments of discovery.",8
"Superhot: Mind Control Delete somehow manages to give a lot more of the same slow-mo action without becoming tiresome or boring. However, things do get bogged down towards the end when the game has a little too much fun at the player's expense.",8
"MotoGP 08 is a refined version of ""SBK 08,"" also from Milestone. Graphics, physics and gameplay are quite similar in both games. It´s best addition is the inclusion of three classes, which greatly improves its life cycle. With a few more improvements on mechanics and global atmosphere, it could stand as a very entertaining title for every racing gamer fan to consider.",8
"Monster Hunter: Freedom tries to capture the odd, free-form gameplay that made its console counterpart so quirky, but its load problems, aggravating combat, lame AI and lack of online play dulls its blade immeasurably.",3
"Madden NFL 25 is a superior game to its predecessor, whether in terms of animations, artificial intelligence, menus or Career Mode. However, don't expect anything really new or innovative, just detailed coverage of the NFL with no surprises.",8
"Time Crisis: Razing Storm is a gaming packaging that brings together both ends of the quality spectrum. Two out of the three games are worth your time and money, and if you can fully ignore the third then you're laughing. If you already own a copy of Time Crisis 4 then don't bother with this - otherwise, this may well be the multiplayer shooter you've been looking for.",7
"A series of unlockable wardrobe items do little to massage the questionable value for money factor of what is ultimately a short game that puts an interesting, er, ‘spin’, on the classic Sonic gameplay, yet fails to live up to such past successes.",6
"It was easy to be drawn into A Total War Saga: TROY. Through its blend of myth, legend, and history. And in striking that balance between the Warhammer entries and Three Kingdoms, Creative Assembly has presented its own Trojan Horse -- another visually impressive addition filled with Total War goodness.",8
"Ever Forward has so much potential. Due to the unused graphic style and soulful story, developer Pathea could have created a real indie pearl. The gameplay around the frustrating puzzles prevents that, although great puzzles crept in in between, which I was happy to break my head about. At the latest because of the stressful puzzles with time pressure, I often lost the fun of the game. Especially the gravity puzzles at the end are one cramp. It's a shame, it could have been so good ...",6
"If you’re willing work though the interface and aren’t opposed to saving and reloading over and over again, you’ll find that Soldiers has legs. What we’d like to see in a future release is a cleaner interface and a more clearly defined design.",6
"Once Human is certainly not a highly original production and has a forgettable story. Luckily it's also a really enjoyable survival game, which can be played completely free of charge. Unlike many other free to play productions, the NetEase one has no in-app purchases that speed up progression or make it easier for the user, putting everyone on the same level. This factor, the accessibility of the experience and the absence of elements capable of generating frustration, make it one of the most interesting exponents of the genre seen in recent times. It will now be up to the developers to work hard to fix the problems and support Once Human with new content, even despite some questionable choices.",8
"It’s a savage game; the only thing more violent that the damage inflicted on Wolverine is the rapid and nonchalant dismemberment of everyone he comes into contact with. Mature’s one word for it: absurd and childish are other, more accurate words. But it’s a brilliant kind of ridiculous nonsense that’ll occasionally pull reluctant cheers out of your grown-up neck.",8
"Turok 2: Seeds of Evil returns, two decades after the original release, in what is an overall improved experience that leaves behind hardware limits but respects the original's elements and design. Investing in new controls is also something to praise but it's impossible not to notice that the game's concept feels outdated and that beyond the public of the original, it might be difficult to convince anyone else to put their hands on this version.",6
"The Waylanders tries to imitate a variety of mechanics from leaders of the RPG genre, but fails to implement any of them effectively, while offering nothing original apart from the astonishingly poor dialogue.",4
"This isn't a crowning moment only for the PS2 generation, but for all of the Final Fantasy series. Long after the PS2 is forgotten, this installment will live in the memories of those who experienced it.",10
"The frustration of the platforming and stealth in Billy's levels is too much to go unnoticed, but thankfully the villainous Uncle Ray saves the day with his rootin' tootin' shooting action.",7
"Blade Kitten has an apt look and offers good platforming, but it suffers from repetitiveness and a marked lack of originality that should always be present in a good platform game.",5
Bloodline Champions offers fast paced and incredibly entertaining action. Play for free online and battle on many kinds of maps against players from around the world. The game mixes tactics with pure skill and the result is superb.,8
I'm appreciating it not out of some overly indulgent childhood nostalgia but rather for what it's doing right now. It's been way too long since the Transformers property has been this good but High Moon's take on the universe is shaping up to be the modernized reboot the franchise desperately needs.,8
"Everspace looks charming, but after 2-3 hours even these beautiful space vistas and intense dogfights will tire you out. Problem is, the whole game is just it: you kill AI enemies and collect their loot.",6
"The real draw here are the minigames, and as always, they are all new. Of course, some are variations on themes passed down, but there are more than enough that surprise and delight to no end. [Dec 2003, p.80]",8
"The amazing Rocksteady Arkham trilogy ends with this awesome game. Maybe the Batmobile is overused, but if you switch over the many gameplay experiences that the new Batman brings you will be less likely to get bored.",9
"Amazingly enough, Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team is still an enjoyable game in spite of all its technical issues, and that's a credit to the purity of its design. If you're a fan of Warhammer 40,000 or killing stuff in general, chances are good you'll enjoy giving this one a go. Just don't be surprised if it feels like the Orks did some of the programming.",6
"Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective is a perfect storm of clever puzzles, suspenseful storytelling, and spectacular visuals that hasn't been witnessed since the heyday of LucasArts adventures. The linear plot makes this a one-time experience, but one that is so enthralling and witty that you'll be thankful for the opportunity.",8
"Fallen Legion is a title that showed promise, with great 2D sprite work and a combat engine that is reminiscent of Tri Ace’s classic, Valkyrie Profile. However, due to a myriad of factors, it falls short of fully realizing its aspirations due to its humdrum story and chaotic, oftentimes dull combat.",6
"The addition of tank combat thematically clashes with everything Batman stands for, but it is fun, and having access to the Batmobile for the first time gives us a new world of possibilities for interacting with Gotham City. Arkham Knight is an outstanding game on almost every level.",9
"After many years of average games, Sega finally gets back on the tracks with Sonic Colors: everything the fans were hoping for is here, packed with gorgeous graphics and solid new game mechanics.",8
"A game with amazing atmosphere, and one of the best post apocalyptic settings around. Unfortunately it's also an easier and more streamlined experience compared to its predecessor, at least at the base difficulty level. 4A Games could have chosen the survival road, making this a truly unique and challenging experience. By going for the ""safe"" choice they created a good fps, but not an unforgettable one.",8
"The dragon's return has not occurred with the same force as expected. Fans will have their ration of TES: Online for a while, but Elsweyr feels less than the previous two expansions.",7
"Monster Hunter is certainly an acquired taste. But if you can appreciate the appeal of crafting, if RPGs aren't just about you leveling something, and if you're willing to try something completely different, you're in for a long, open-ended treat.",8
"A very clever puzzle-platformer, with an unique visual style and highly challenging puzzles. It just lacks on the narrative/philosophical side, but it's definitely recommended to lovers of cerebral challenges.",8
"Though never fun in real life, spilling ink all around is even more fun in Splatoon 2 than it was in the first game. Teaming up with your squid friends has never been better. But even though some weird Nintendo elements can drag the fun to a stall, everywhere that Splatoon 2 shines makes it a deserving heir to the original.",8
Having to deal with Rogue States' frustrating AI is a bit like playing a multiplayer game with some guy who keeps breaking up the game by walking away from his computer to grab a snack from the kitchen.,5
"It doesn't have the longevity that we'd like, but it's one of the only games in the series to really make you feel like you're playing war with the plastic men you grew up with in a fun, satisfying way.",8
"I’ve just rolled the credits as I write this review, and it feels like there’s a hole in me. It longs for more stages, it wants to chase that exhilaration. I’m hoping that someone goads me on Twitter tomorrow, to spur me into rushing back into the early stages. I can’t wait to get back out there with a purpose. Neon White has style. Neon White has intensity. Neon White makes me feel alive.",10
"The surreal and decadent world of After Us is impressive: although it is not a large-caliber production, the developers of Piccolo Studio have been masters in using the means at their disposal to create impactful visual compositions. The mechanics aren’t innovative per se, but the chain of tools made available to the player, combined with a certain freedom granted during exploration, allows the action to settle on a good pace.",7
"The maddening difficulty level of this game destroys it. If you’re truly patient, then maybe, just maybe you might be able to get something out of it.., but if you’re like me who plays games to be entertained, I think you’re going to find yourself wanting to return this one.",5
"A modern take on the cult classic Master of Orion. The drawback is that while it offers almost perfectly executed traditional 4X gameplay, it fails to throw anything fresh on top of it. [07/2017, p.40]",8
"Splatoon 3’s Side Order DLC puts players into a rogue-like single-player campaign as Agent 8, tasked with rescuing Marina and her friends from the mysterious Deca Tower. Each run through the tower offers a new set of challenges and opportunities to customize abilities and weapons, leading to multiple playthroughs and strategic planning. While some levels may prove more challenging, especially with unfamiliar weapons, Side Order offers a refreshing departure from multiplayer chaos with its replay value and different gameplay options.",8
"As a big fan of the original back in the day, I admit that perhaps Pac-Man World hasn't held up as well as I thought it would. With that being said, Pac-Man World Re-Pac is definitely a cute and colourful game that's full of fun gameplay and rewarding collectibles.",8
"Solo fighters can also duke it out with the CPU, but the real draw here is CNPTE's surprisingly fleshed-out story mode. Lightning-quick combat, loads of unlockable characters, fun stages that effectively capture the flavor of the source material, and varied challenges should keep fans absorbed throughout. It's not about to rob Smash Bros. of its championship belt, but it's still a thumb-blistering good time for anyone who can claim to have spent a few couch-bound afternoons soaking in Cartoon Network's unique brand of boob-tube fare.",7
"Tiberium Wars does what the series has always done best; providing the most enjoyable RTS experience around via excellent storytelling, enjoyable campaigns and a lasting multiplayer experience.",9
"Almost two decades on, Onimusha: Warlords lives again thanks to a handful of truly impactful changes. Those tank controls are lighter to the touch and the improvements to the visuals help take the edge off those clunky PS2-era looks. The updated soundtrack might be a little inferior, but even it brings an extra layer of authenticity to a game that draws from Japan’s rich history of warfare. Hopefully, the rest of the series will get the same treatment because this classic swashbuckling adventure (with the occasional moment of horror) has just re-sharpened its blade, and we're happy to have it back.",8
"From the explosive tankers to the destructible environments, Shatter Bay makes a great first impression. Franchise loyalists may be turned off by this brand new direction, but anybody who loves Burnout will have a blast playing through Ridge Racer Unbounded. It's not without a few problems, but Namco's newest racer packs enough content to make up for any imperfection!",8
"Neon White is everything you want from a speedrunning game: fast, super precise, well structured and built around short and various levels. This alone would be enough to recommend it, but the package is completed with a unique artistic style, a valuable writing and a clearly original and strange game design that mixes together visual novel, dating sim, first person shooter and platformer. Some very small technical uncertainty in the repetition of the attempts does not affect the overall quality.",9
"This game's visuals are more a bitter pill for the eyes than a feast, and most of your time is spent jamming on the A button; but I couldn't help but enjoy Dark Legacy. [May 2002, p.84]",7
"Polished, intuitive, balanced, and fun, this is one of the best RTS games ever made, but if you&#146;re bored with the genre this isn&#146;t going to suddenly make you a believer again.",9
"Plan, build, fight and repair. Those are the four fundamental parts of Lock's Quest, an unexpectedly demanding game for the DS. It's surprisingly addictive, but due to some parts of the game not being blessed with the coat of finish they need we can't bless this game with a higher grade.",7
"There's also a sneaking sense that Origins is stuck in the past. As a reimagining of the original game with modern visuals, it's a triumph, but it doesn't do much to move the realtime tactics genre forward, with little of the innovation seen in, say, Mimimi's Shaodow Gambit: The Cursed Crew. [Issue#410, p.116]",7
"Let's imagine for a moment that Constantine's only way into Heaven was to make a great videogame, and he turned this one in as his submission-I'm afraid he would already be on his way down to the lake of fire for an eternal purgatory lunch date with a certain Mr. Satan.",6
"In the end, the four episodes speak of two different experiences. Barry's campaign has its moments, but Moira's is always trying to keep up, with small success. It's still a Resident Evil experience that might please some of the fanbase (and not even the most nostalgic part, because of the almost action gameplay), but not a great return for the historic saga.",7
"Again, good moves – and Madden 25 is a good game. But it isn't a great one. And with a more fun football experience now housed in the same building, it's tough to see how that changes anytime soon.",7
"The price is too high, for what is proposed: the title does not exploit any feature of the console and, above all, cancels - with a rather unpleasant graphic rendering - the only competitive advantage with which it could still play, namely portability. Such a pity.",6
"A Total War Saga: Troy is a good addition to the franchise, but it is not recommended for new players. However, fans of the historical setting Total War games shouldn't hesitate to check this one out.",8
"Visual Concepts once again gives us the definitive basketball experience in the world of videogames. Coinciding with the twenty-third anniversary of the numbering of their games, they could only point to excellence. The gameplay looks sharper and more precise than ever, the vintage game modes take us back to incredible times and MyTEAM and MyCareer remain a safe bet. Without a doubt, essential for lovers of sports games.",9
"Mr. Wake, welcome to the mass market: less demanding, more casual than the original. New players will be eased into the world of Alan Wake and fans will surely enjoy the new Fight till Dawn mode in addition to having some loving memories on the original game.",9
"The punchy comedic pacing that works so well in a series of video shorts does not hold up when stretched out over a few hours, and the few times you do chuckle will only punctuate the fact that such moments are few and far between.",5
"Ikenfell is definitely a game worth experiencing if someone appreciates any of its parts. Like RPGs with unusual battle systems? It has that. Love chiptune soundtracks or the music from Steven Universe? Stop on by. Appreciate the idea of a life as a student at a magical academy where things are surprisingly hazardous? This is a good alternative! Not to mention, it’s a very inclusive game that can be comedic, dramatic, and heartfelt. There are some hiccups, sure, but it’s generally satisfying.",7
"We've come to expect a missing coat of polish on film tie-ins, but Iron Man seems to lack even a level of care, resulting in a drab adaptation that sinks well beyond simple mediocrity.",3
"The physics feels smooth and responsive in a way that works for me, and it’s satisfying to launch off a ramp in ball form, transform to shoot an enemy mid-air, transform back to dash into another enemy and then send them off the level in one smooth motion. Because of moments like this, Go Mecha Ball has rolled its way to being one of my favorite games of the year in just a few short hours.",8
"Overall, I really enjoyed the experience in NERF: N-Strike Elite. The game is fun while it lasts and the separate dart gun works well at pestering your friends, co-workers, significant others, pets, siblings, etc.",7
"Ultimately Banana Mania is a lot of fun, and a solid starting point to those new to the series. Long term fans might find the changes to accommodate a wider audience just too bitter a pill to swallow though.",7
"One of the best party games for Kinect, thanks to a very good variety of activities, up to 16 players support, and enteraining use of alternate reality and perfect movement recognition; the Rabbids' scoffing comedy pervading the entire game is just the icing on top.",9
"Everything from the tried and true LEGO gameplay sprinkled with some great new additions, a comedic script, and an entertaining storyline provides a gaming experience suitable for all ages which, in my eyes, makes LEGO City Undercover a must buy for fans of the LEGO franchise and Wii U owners alike.",10
"If you like a deep, interesting story in your RPGs, Valkyria Revolution will deliver. There’s a compelling 70-plus hours of content her that almost justifies its Shakespearean ambitions – despite the slings and arrows of boring combat, and the sound and fury of long cutscenes. If the question is To Play or Not to Play, I would say play, but just be prepared for a few tragic flaws.",7
"I liked After Us in the end, I appreciated the story it told and the imagery it used to tell it (even if most of it was as blunt as blunt gets). However, what could have felt like a two-hour conversation is bloated into a ten-hour lecture series due to overly large worlds with very little to do in them. It seems like there was an internal struggle between ""brevity in storytelling"" or ""filling the world with collectibles,"" though unfortunately, the solution they reached was far from the most efficient. If you can stomach the slog, there's a beautiful, important message to be heard in After Us. Unfortunately, and ironically, it's buried in excess.",6
"The F1 2013 package is extremely slick, whichever mode you play, and all the classic content feels like a labour of love. It's a fitting way to conclude current-gen F1, polishing the contemporary and reflecting on the old before the next-gen version inevitably brings in the new in 2014. It’s a touching ode to an era when Formula One was truly magical.",9
"Technical issues aside, I greatly enjoyed my time in the Heretic Kingdoms. The hack-n-slash combat with puppeteering strategies always felt fresh, the enemies always presented a challenge on the Normal difficulty, and I never got tired of the vast exploration and puzzle solving.",8
"SMAA doesn't aim to do anything particularly novel, preferring to embrace the clone nature of the game and make that aspect as good as it can be. There's no doubt they made the right decision there, as you'll be hard pressed to not enjoy your time with SMAA.",8
"Some aspects of Majora’s Mask haven’t aged quite that well, and one boss fight has been changed dramatically for the worse, but on the whole, Nintendo has done a stellar job updating the quirkiest and most thematically rich Zelda game for newcomers and old fans alike.",9
"Splicing history with Hollywood, Troy is an exciting new take on the Total War formula. Sega's immense strategy series continues to snowball, absorbing and shedding new ideas, somehow keeping momentum despite that core gameplay remaining virtually untouched.",8
"The level designs may lack the intricacy, and consequently the intensity, of the studio's high watermark titles (Ikaruga; Gunstar Heroes) and the constant left-to-right blandness is a possible criticism, but, primarily because of the narrative ingenuity injected into a typically 'action-at-all-costs' genre, Astro Boy still feels like something of a landmark title for the GBA, and for side-scrolling games in general.",8
"For some people, the story will be compelling enough to make it worth playing through the single-player missions once, but the same effect can be comparably achieved by renting ""Goodfellas"" again.",6
"House Flipper seems like a killer idea for a sim game, and while your first few sales deliver some of the before-and-after magic, the game fails to capture the larger remodeling fantasy. Empyrean has been delivering a steady stream of updates and improvements to House Flipper, but it’ll take a lot more elbow grease to get this fixer-upper ready for market.",6
"Lost Records: Bloom & Rage – Tape 1 is everything you’d want from a DON’T NOD game: realistic characters, a gripping journey, and a sci-fi-infused adventure. While it doesn’t break new ground in the genre, it delivers a well-rounded, intriguing story. The first part lays the foundation for multiple compelling narrative threads. With its rich character drama and lingering mysteries, Tape 2’s release on April 15th can’t come soon enough.",8
"A few griefers are a small price to pay, however, for the experience of a well-oiled four-player game of Monaco, and for the assistance this provides toward unlocking the entirety of the second campaign, which, as if channeling The Unusual Suspects, returns you to previous areas, but with an entirely new perspective.",8
"FC 25's gameplay familiarity may trigger initial disappointment, but career mode tweaks and the brilliant Rush mode soon pull you back in for another year. Ultimate Team, meanwhile, remains divisive as ever – but fans of that mode will love its myriad fan-service additions.",8
"Whether or not you fancy yourself a platformer aficionado, Alwa’s Legacy should be on your playlist. It combines retro graphics with modern precision to create a wonderfully engaging experience that strikes a fun balance between platforming and puzzle solving.",8
"The biggest problem with this collection is the interface. How did we play these games back in the day? Dials, trackballs, joysticks, and those arcade micro-switch buttons with that distinctive 'click'. Sure, the game is playable with a mouse and keyboard, but to the people who want this game the most, it isn't the same.",7
"Kung Fu Rabbit is a worthy contender to an afternoon of rabbit leaping, challenging platform action. It looks pretty and handles well but still feels very much like a mobile game at heart.",7
"Starship Troopers Extermination is aimed mainly at the most hardcore fans of the franchise. Those who want arachnid blood in their eyes, and to spit tons of lead on hundreds of creatures simultaneously. On that, no worries, you will have what you are looking for. For the others, however, it is another story. If we will willingly move beyond the visual aspect of the game, obviously below standards, it is difficult to find an excuse when it comes to talking about the ultimately redundant gameplay loop that never surprises us. Not to mention the ambient chaos, messy and unreadable where the competition has managed to make it fun and epic. The idea of having up to 16 players cooperate is fun, but only on paper since in reality, it is hell. On consoles (here the PS5 version) unfortunately it does not even manage to keep up with the framerate when things get worse, which happens... all the time. The end result clearly doesn't live up to expectations, even considering the caliber of the game. This Starship Troopers Extermination even forgot to set the mood outside of the battlefield, which is a shame.",5
"I badly wanted Beyond Eyes to use its attractively whitewashed look and novel, visually limited ideas to tell a much more moving story whose empathetic lessons could’ve stayed with me long after the end credits rolled, but it didn’t.",6
"Loop Hero was a great surprise for me. The idea of a game just going in circles had me hesitant at first. It turned out to be a wonderful little treat. The story and art style are solid and the music is fair, but the meat really lies in the gameplay. The world-building allows you to personalize it, but also to develop your own strategy. It becomes addicting and enticing to anyone. Even someone like me who struggles with in-game strategy began to just stop, think, and develop the plan for a long game even in the first run of a loop. These mechanics are really what help bring the game to a higher level and pull it up than just a normal 16-bit Adventure/RPG game. While a simple concept on the face, Loop Hero has mountains more depth behind it.",9
Maybe it is the nicest city sim but unfortunately it's only the empty shell. Too many design mistakes and an user-unfriendly interface make Cities XL 2012 wasted opportunity. [Dec 2011],5
"Shovel Knight Showdown takes the popular indie platformer series and turns it into a four-player arena battler, with great results. With a large amount of unlockable content, in-game challenges, and solo modes, it's a deceptively robust package that has the potential to be a long-term party staple. Shovel Knight Showdown is great even if you've never played the original games.",9
"Every race has its own narrative, but it doesn’t work like it did in Endless Legends: tasks feel disjointed and random, and there’s no victory by completing the storyline. Procedurally generated quests are even more arbitrary, and Academy storyline can’t quench thirst for good storytelling on its own. [Issue#221, p.90]",7
"Despite its best efforts, developer Platinum Games sometimes gets in the way of its own pace -- especially for those who aren’t into the franchise. However, Rising’s troubles are rarely enough to derail the incredible momentum of an always-entertaining, action-oriented Metal Gear spinoff.",8
"Overall, Ridge Racer Unbounded is a great game with some fairly annoying problems that drag it down. The good news is I think they're all issues that could be addressed with a patch - the bad news is I don't know of one coming out, which means that while this game is worth your time, I don't quite think it's worth full-price in its present state.",8
"This is now the fifth time I have played Xenoblade Chronicles, and I've enjoyed it every time in the same way that I enjoy re-reading a good book. The game's themes, storytelling standards, and tone are all spot on. This is an interesting and fundamentally deep game that highlights the best of what is possible within the JRPG structure. It's a little disappointing that the developers didn't take this opportunity to tackle some of the superfluous stuff that is at odds with the better elements, and I've yet to be won over by the new narrative arc and whether it does anything to actually build on what was already a perfectly dense work. However, the core of the game is that powerful that the main reason to buy into this - that visual re-work - is more than enough to be worthwhile in itself.",9
"And don't try enlisting a few friends for some four-player co-op: it doesn't make the game any more exciting. Sure, having a few friends around makes those hordes disappear a little faster, and there are some extra quests you can take on, but the core experience remains as glacial as ever.",4
"Mario's shouts of excitement are much more subdued than we're used to, and there doesn't seem to be quite the usual level of ambience in general. Some will prefer this, but I didn't.",9
"Overall Fate/Extella is a decent game, the quick and extravagant combat gives the game lashings of style and visual flair. Unfortunately the lack of depth to the combat leads to repetition setting in and the story is definitely not for the uninitiated. This game fits well with the other musou games available for the PlayStation 4, and while it’s not the best one of the bunch it’s decent while it lasts.",6
"High Hell's refreshing honesty and unfamiliar naivete have kept me entertained for at least a few hours...A minimalist, very entertaining and action-packed low budget shooter with the right dose of chaos, humor and madness.",8
"Exploring Warsaw at the onset of the 20th century and its many political and social topics is a fantastic experience. Expect intriguing characters, mature themes, enjoyable exploration and plenty of narrative role-play options. On the negative side, the combat quickly becomes repetitive, and some gameplay mechanics feel undercooked.",8
"Few games in the world are as multilayered in their appeal as Senko no Ronde 2. It’s positively exceptional, melding a fighting game into a 2D shooter then using that as the basis for a visual novel. That story goes on to become the fabric of every mecha fan’s dreams, featuring the best tropes of space operas along alongside more substantial commentary. It’s a pleasant reminder that story-driven games don’t need to rely on the RPG format.",9
"All in all, Onimusha HD is a wonderful return to the first entry in a long and well-loved series. It wouldn’t be a bad thing if Capcom continues to overhaul these PS2 and GameCube era classics.",8
"Metro: Last Light is a good sequel that combines stealth mechanics with classic FPS gunplay versus mutants. Great story, characters and narrative with some issues in Enemy AI reactions and too many scripts. Not ambitious enough as a sequel, but a great and immersive experience.",8
"There are redeeming features, a few nice touches of scripting here and a cool boss there, but generally the fabled shitty-stick of non-touching is going to have to make another one of his increasingly common appearances. [PC Zone]",6
Third part continues where it had ended long time ago – it was sufficiently long ago for Amanita to make completely new and unprecedented features. Just a pity they show their best cards too soon. [Issue#262],8
"It's not just rehash, Ninja-Five-O does have some originality even though it borrows heavily from a variety of platformers. But you can't go wrong when you borrow all the best elements of classic games.",8
"South of Midnight is a pure mid-budget game that doesn't even try to challenge the biggest launches of the first half of the year, but has enough character and charm to provide about ten hours of decent fun.",8
"Saturnalia is an adventure that shows off its Italian roots by creating an intriguing story, although not too original, capable of exploiting Sardinian folklore and a credible setting within a highly inspired sensory frame. It works more on a conceptual and visual level than on a strictly playful one, but it is an imbalance that does not excessively affect the pleasure of the experience.",7
"Although Midnight Club II is no match for the mighty ""Burnout 2"" it is worth a purchase if street racing is your thing. There is a nice selection of missions and cars to choose from and the urge to keep trying again is present in most of the levels.",8
"There will be inevitable comparisons to Neversoft's GUN, but CoJ feels much more a next-gen version of the lackluster Dead Man's Hand than anything else. And it's about as worthwhile a purchase.",5
"Finally, adding some longevity to the game, Under Siege includes a fairly powerful level editor that's at least on par with most PC games. While the game's light on actual strategy and heavy on micromanagement and instant to instant tactics, it's still not a bad choice for people looking for quick, RTS-style skirmishes on the PS3.",7
"To say there’s a lot to hate about Concord implies it has a lot of anything. While not strictly skeletal in content, it nonetheless offers little of note in a market that’s already saturated with similar games all vying to dominate the finite time of their players. Sony’s delivered the perfect picture of a game nobody was asking for, an impeccable example of the nonessential product. Even if I didn’t hate it, I sure as hell wouldn’t find enough to love.",4
"Everything about The First Berserker: Khazan is entirely competent. It's a fun and well put-together Soulslike that would serve well as someone's first dip into the genre, especially if the stereotype of high difficulty usually frightens them off. At the same time, Khazan doesn't do anything particularly new that makes it stand out from the crowd. This isn't necessarily a problem, especially if you're a fan of the DFO universe, but it means you need to be in the right mood and mindset to play Khazan.",8
"For fans of the Trials series looking for a similar experience on Nintendo Switch, Urban Trial Playground comes highly recommended. It may not feel like quite as skillful a game to play, but it's still challenging and entertaining nonetheless. It also packs quite a lot of content for its budget price.",7
"In the end, Myths of the Eastern Realm feels like an abbreviated version of the core Immortals Fenyx Rising experience. The main character and the gods have been swapped out, but little has changed in the overall feel. It's not a bad expansion by any means, and if you enjoyed the original, this is a good excuse to fire up the game again to explore a new region. The superficial treatment of the underlying content feels like a real missed opportunity. Given the care that Ubisoft typically puts into research for its games, Myths of the Eastern Realm comes across as more akin to Cliffs Notes than a novel.",7
"It's a cute game that is intuitive and plays well (as long as you keep it on mute). Nice retro feel, but unfortunately does not grow out of its mobile roots. Not bad...but not exactly good.",6
"It isn’t a perfect encapsulation of the sport, but it is the best one to have appeared on any handheld in recent memory, and one which makes fine use of the Unreal Engine to generate some high-fidelity looks on the Vita’s OLED screen.",7
"It's remarkable how skillfully so many different ideas are blended together into one game. It's equally impressive that it looks and sounds great, has no noticeable load time, tells a decent story, and doesn't saddle the player with restrictions on where to go and what to do.",8
"You should buy this game because it's frightening in a way that few games ever have been, and because it's a vividly explored, engrossing narrative the likes of which few out-and-out storytellers like ""Final Fantasy"" can compete with.",9
"Where the title could have opened up to a more heterogeneous audience, it chose to give up on any guides or tutorials, making learning much slower and tiring to the less experienced, in some ways even frustrating.",6
"But Age of Empires II HD is still probably the game I’ll go back to most. It’s more interesting, more expansive, better balanced—all the things you’d want from a sequel, basically. And that wouldn’t normally be an issue, except for the fact that Age of Empires: Definitive Edition arrived after its sequel this time around.",8
"The Last Story and Xenoblade Chronicles are two different games which both try to achieve certain similar goals, however, The Last Story often shows potential without ever fully succeeding in basically every field. Visuals are absolutely pretty but special effects cause heavy FPS drops; battles are intriguing but extremely easy and confusing; the story itself is well told but very cliché. It's an overall good game, although it doesn't live up to its own hype.",8
"So if you want an intense shooter with solid ground on every aspect, but nothing special in content or in extras, then pick up Xyanide, and bring yourself back to those local pizza place days, playing the arcade games we all love so much.",8
The latest installment in the Mario & Sonic series just feels sloppy instead of the HD reboot it should have been. It's way to similar to the previous games and they clearly haven't had a single clue how to utilize the Wii U Gamepad for the events.,4
"There's seldom a dull moment in this game, and when one arises it's intentional. Raven completely outdid themselves with this game, delivering one of the best Marvel games yet to ship.",8
"As a step in the series' continued evolution, Void is both surprising and well done. It doesn't quite top my favorite in the series, Core, which has catchier music that remains a larger part of its design, but it comes close (Void does have music from Nullsleep, a very good chiptunes artist, however).",9
"As such a strong multiplayer game, Mario Kart: Double Dash!! deserves your money. Ignore those cynical, angry critics; this game might not be a revolution, but it's a hell of an evolution.",9
"It&#146;s not the prettiest, nor the best sounding game around, far from it, but the gameplay gives it a heart and soul a lot of technically superior games can only dream of, making Excitebike relevant all these years after its original release.",7
"Trek to Yomi is a game you should try at some point, no matter what kind of game you prefer. It may not impress with its combat system and linear gameplay structure, but both its flawless cinematics and unparalleled atmosphere are enough to make it memorable.",8
"For those expecting a Kirby-like platformer experience due to the game being from HAL Laboratory, you will likely be disappointed. Instead, Part Time UFO feels more like a series of wacky extended WarioWare type levels that will keep you addicted as you strive to earn every medal in the game.",7
"Filled with countless remember-when moments-as in ""Remember when you outran that wave of sand?""-Shattered Dimensions is less literary and artful than Batman: Arkham Asylum, but it's far more fun.",8
"Scrappy design and presentation mean that it's hard to give Zombie Driver a more enthusiastic thumbs up - but as a particularly goofy example of the sort of guilty gaming pleasure that rarely gets a look-in amongst the autumn blockbusters, it's impossible to dislike.",6
"Nickelodeon Kart Racers 3: Slime Speedway isn’t the worst kart racer I’ve ever played, but again, it’s also not the best especially when compared to previous entries in the series. As previously mentioned, Nickelodeon Kart Racers 3: Slime Speedway is a middle of the road racer in almost every aspect save for its character roster, graphics, and elements like picking three characters to be part of your pit crew.",6
"We Are OFK came out of nowhere and immediately captured my attention. While the game’s concept has been done before on TV, this is, to my knowledge, the first time a video game has told the story of a fictional (or perhaps I should say, virtual) band that makes and releases real music. Really good music that I may or may not be listening to as I write this review. The plot has a few pacing issues and the gameplay is limited, but the art style is undeniably attractive, the writing is great, and I love the cast. If a future sequel — shall we say a season two? — means more time with these messed-up goofballs and more great music, I’m all for it.",8
"Your main objective is the bane of the modern FPS: follow a little blue arrow while shooting things, with the odd escort or protect responsibility thrown in to make you turn around occasionally. It's average justice dished out to the licence, but nothing more. [Christmas 2003, p.121]",5
"Resistance: Burning Skies can be linear and its mission objectives predictable, but it has the look and feel of a fully-fledged shooter, and that's something you won't find elsewhere. The visuals look almost on par with its PS3 forebears on the smaller screen and the gameplay endeavours match them in scope and intensity. In theory, it should be a classic, but a weak story and straightforward missions makes it only surface-deep.",6
"Once Human might be the first crafting game I find myself coming back to regularly thanks to solid combat fundamentals, a perfectly-tuned crafting loop, and a level of polish that’s often all too rare in the genre.",8
"Many of you will have a problem with accepting some of the new gaming solutions, for many this game will never surpass you-know-which installment of the series, but nevertheless you should give the new Heroes a chance. I don't regret the time spent with Heroes VI and truthfully - it gave me more satisfaction than playing HoMM V a few years back. There is no doubt that Ubisoft made a right choice by choosing a hungarian team to develop this game. I'm waiting for more.",8
"[eM] is most impressive when placed in its proper context: From Software managed to craft a sprawling, 60-hour-long, traditional J-RPG on a next-generation platform in an incredibly short ammount of time....and it's actually pretty darn good. [Mar 2006, p.61]",8
"Had Jak II delivered a gameplay revolution as dramatic and massive as its graphics (BEST LOOKING ACTION PS2 GAME... EVER!), excellent sounds (which take into account non-English speaking players), buttery-smooth controls and solid interface this could have become the PS2 equivalent of ""Super Mario 64.""",9
"Gameplay quickly becomes an exercise in futility and patience. The control of the game is very slow and unresponsive, further hurt from the inability to discern most wrestlers from the next.",4
"Rocksteady built a special experience that dazzles with its cleverness, intelligence, and ability to shift from kick-ass Batman moments to emotional gut punches to scenes stripped straight from some of Batman's greatest comic book stories. Lock yourself away, avoid social media and friends, and finish this game. You won't want this one spoiled for you.",10
"The visuals will likely turn most off to what is quite honestly one of the most entertaining RPGs to hit the PS2, but a general lack of even casual steering towards the storyline does make the game seem aimless at times. Still, it's worth the adventure.",8
"An unconventional city builder where the city builds itself, while your task is to optimize its road traffic, which requires quick thinking, good planning and a pinch of luck. It’s easy to turn a blind eye to minimalistic visuals, irritating audio and some flaws, because what’s really important is the fact that Mini Motorways is highly addictive. [10/2021, p.62]",8
"The developer deserves props for doing something genuinely interesting in a staid genre. Shadows: Awakening is familiar enough, but it has some enjoyably unique mechanics that help to elevate it, and a world to explore that's genuinely captivating. It would be great to see the developer get a chance to do more with this franchise.",8
"Not awful but far from good, Fate/Extella: The Umbral Star is a title that lets down fans and keeps away newcomers with a pithy story, mediocre gameplay, and a generic art direction that betrays the franchise’s roots.",6
"Party games are supposed to contain playable sequences that are instantly accessible, engaging, and fun. In Fuzion Frenzy 2, there are precious few that fit that bill. [Apr 2007, p.56]",4
